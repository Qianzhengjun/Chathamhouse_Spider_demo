"Meeting the Promise of the 2010 Constitution: Devolution, Gender and Equality in Kenya",UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/meeting-promise-2010-constitution-devolution-gender-and-equality-kenya,"Reports, Papers, Briefings","Despite enshrining gender equality in law, Kenya’s 2010 constitution has failed to deliver the transformation many had hoped for. This paper highlights the importance of devolution in enhancing gender equality in Kenya and suggests practical ways forward to facilitate gender-responsive budgeting and planning.
The 2010 constitution was intended to transform the lives of Kenya’s minorities and marginalized groups, notably women. It enshrined equality in law, and led to the establishment of key institutions aimed at promoting and protecting minorities, particularly women.
But 10 years on, women remain significantly marginalized in Kenya. The government has failed to comply with the constitution and has not adequately funded or supported gender policy commitments. Little progress has been made towards mainstreaming gender considerations into fiscal policy or budgetary decisions. Programmes to support women’s economic participation and entrepreneurship have been small-scale, marginal and short-term.
The other centrepiece of the 2010 constitution was the ‘big bang’ devolution of power to Kenya’s 47 county governments, implemented in 2013. This had the potential to reshape gender dynamics in Kenya and to improve county governments’ decision-making. County governments represent the level of government closest to the people, and are therefore better positioned than national-level policymakers to directly address gender inequality.
Devolved government has faced significant challenges, including incoherent national policymaking and leadership, weak technical capacity at county level, poorly implemented or non-existent mechanisms for public consultation, and a lack of gender-disaggregated data on which to base policymaking.
Despite these obstacles, some counties have made real progress. But overall the impact of devolution on equality has been limited. Projects to help marginalized groups still account for a minimal percentage of county government budgets, and fail to address the systematic gendered impacts of decision-making and budgeting. There is a glaring gap between policy commitments and actual investments by county governments.
However, devolved governance in Kenya is in its infancy and still offers a window of opportunity for effective policy initiatives and real-world change. An approach that emphasizes genderresponsive budgeting can begin to address systematic inequalities, including through gender budget statements, the collection of accurate gender-disaggregated statistics, and the provision of adequate support to mechanisms for public consultation. Effective oversight is possible through elected county assemblies. National and county treasuries should spearhead initiatives in this field with relevant support from all stakeholders.
Gender-responsive budgeting is sustainable only if policymakers at both central and local levels of government own the process. This depends on sustained political will. There are multiple cross-cutting cultural, political and economic dynamics that shape outcomes in Kenya, most of which lie outside the scope of this paper. Further research is necessary. But though its first 10 years have not brought the change that Kenya’s most marginalized people had hoped to see, the 2010 constitution can still fulfil its promise, and act as an effective vehicle for achieving broadbased and sustainable equality for all.

The Minsk Conundrum: Western Policy and Russia’s War in Eastern Ukraine,UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/minsk-conundrum-allan,"Reports, Papers, Briefings","The Minsk agreements rest on two irreconcilable interpretations of Ukraine’s sovereignty: is Ukraine sovereign, as Ukrainians insist, or should its sovereignty be limited, as Russia demands? Instead of trying to resolve an unresolvable contradiction, Western policymakers should acknowledge the starkness of the Minsk conundrum.
The Minsk agreements of September 2014 and February 2015, which sought to end Russia’s war in eastern Ukraine, rest on two irreconcilable interpretations of Ukraine’s sovereignty – what could be called the ‘Minsk conundrum’: is Ukraine sovereign, as Ukrainians insist, or should its sovereignty be limited, as Russia demands?
Ukraine sees the agreements as instruments with which to re-establish its sovereignty in line with the following sequence: a ceasefire; a Russian withdrawal from eastern Ukraine; return of the Russia/Ukraine border to Ukrainian control; free and fair elections in the Donbas region; and a limited devolution of power to Russia’s proxy regimes, which would be reintegrated and resubordinated to the authorities in Kyiv. Ukraine would be able to make its own domestic and foreign policy choices.
Russia sees the Minsk agreements as tools with which to break Ukraine’s sovereignty. Its interpretation reverses key elements in the sequence of actions: elections in occupied Donbas would take place before Ukraine had reclaimed control of the border; this would be followed by comprehensive autonomy for Russia’s proxy regimes, crippling the central authorities in Kyiv. Ukraine would be unable to govern itself effectively or orient itself towards the West.
These contradictory provisions are testimony to a stunning failure of Russian foreign policy. In 2014 Russia launched a campaign of violent subversion to compel Ukraine to ‘federalize’ its political system. Belying Russian expectations, Ukrainians fought back en masse, forcing Russia to resort to increasingly open military intervention. Russia inflicted crushing defeats on Ukrainian forces, yet was unwilling to pay the price that further high-intensity war would have exacted.
Western views on how to implement the Minsk agreements are imprecise and inconsistent. One prevalent view is that implementation means finding a mid-point between the Russian and Ukrainian positions. However, attempts to do so have failed – heaping pressure on Ukraine, risking political instability in Kyiv, and not leading to any discernible change in Russian policy. Instead of trying to resolve an unresolvable contradiction, Western policymakers should acknowledge the starkness of the Minsk conundrum.
An alternative approach would make the defence of Ukraine’s sovereignty the unambiguous premise of Western policy. It would view the Minsk and Normandy processes mainly as conflict management tools. In line with the priority attached to upholding Ukraine’s sovereignty, Western governments would meanwhile maintain support for long-term political and economic reform in Ukraine, using the EU/Ukraine Association Agreement as the anchor.
This approach would also encourage the authorities in Kyiv to engage more inclusively with those living in occupied Donbas. Yet it would proceed from the assumption that the region should not be legally reincorporated into Ukraine for the foreseeable future. Finally, this approach would logically entail a lengthy stand-off with Russia over Ukraine – a prospect that many decision-makers in the West would find troubling and unnerving.

Coronavirus: Public Health Emergency or Pandemic – Does Timing Matter?,UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/coronavirus-public-health-emergency-or-pandemic-does-timing-matter,Expert Comment,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has been criticized for delaying its announcements of a public health emergency and a pandemic for COVID-19. But could earlier action have influenced the course of events?
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of COVID-19 to be a  (PHEIC) on January 30 this year and then .
Declaring a PHEIC is the highest level of alert that WHO is obliged to declare, and is meant to send a powerful signal to countries of the need for urgent action to combat the spread of the disease, mobilize resources to help low- and middle-income countries in this effort and fund research and development on needed treatments, vaccines and diagnostics. It also obligates countries to share information with WHO.
Once the PHEIC was declared, the virus continued to spread globally, and WHO began to be asked why it had not yet declared the disease a pandemic. But there is no widely accepted definition of a pandemic, generally it is just considered an epidemic which affects many countries globally.
The term has hitherto been applied almost exclusively to new forms of flu, such as H1N1 in 2009 or Spanish flu in 1918, where the lack of population immunity and absence of a vaccine or effective treatments makes the outbreak potentially much more deadly than seasonal flu (which, although global, is not considered a pandemic).
For COVID-19, WHO seemed reluctant to declare a pandemic despite the evidence of global spread. Partly this was because of its influenza origins — WHO’s emergency programme executive director said on March 9 that .
He also expressed concern that the word traditionally meant moving — once there was widespread transmission — from trying to contain the disease by testing, isolating the sick and tracing and quarantining their contacts, to a mitigation approach, implying ‘the disease will spread uncontrolled’.
WHO’s worry was that the world’s reaction to the word pandemic might be there was now nothing to be done to stop its spread, and so countries would effectively give up trying. WHO wanted to send the message that, unlike flu, it could still be pushed back and the spread slowed down.
In announcing the pandemic two days later, WHO’s director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus : ‘We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic’ and that WHO was deeply concerned ‘by the alarming levels of inaction’.
The evidence suggests that the correct message did in fact get through. On March 13, US president Donald Trump , referring in passing to WHO’s announcement. On March 12, the UK launched its own strategy to combat the disease. And in the week following WHO’s announcements, at least 16 other countries announced lockdowns of varying rigour including Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Spain and Switzerland. Italy and Greece had both already instituted lockdowns prior to the WHO pandemic announcement.
It is not possible to say for sure that WHO’s announcement precipitated these measures because, by then, the evidence of the rapid spread was all around for governments to see. It may be that  reverberated around European capitals and elsewhere.
But it is difficult to believe the announcement did not have an effect in stimulating government actions, as was intended by Dr Tedros. Considering the speed with which the virus was spreading from late February, might an earlier pandemic announcement by WHO have stimulated earlier aggressive actions by governments?
Declaring a global health emergency — when appropriate — is a key part of WHO’s role in administering the  (IHR). Significantly, negotiations on revisions to the IHR, which had been ongoing in a desultory fashion in WHO since 1995, were accelerated by the experience of the first serious coronavirus outbreak — SARS — in 2002-2003, leading to their final agreement in 2005.
Under the IHR, WHO’s director-general decides whether to declare an emergency based on a set of criteria and on the advice of an emergency committee. IHR defines an emergency as an ‘extraordinary event that constitutes a public health risk through the international spread of disease and potentially requires a coordinated international response’.
In the case of COVID-19, the committee first met on January 22-23 but were . Following the director-general’s trip to meet President Xi Jinping in Beijing, the committee reconvened on January 30 and .
But admittedly, public recognition of what a PHEIC means is extremely low. Only six have ever been declared, with the first being the H1N1 flu outbreak which fizzled out quickly, despite . During the H1N1 outbreak, WHO declared a PHEIC in April 2009 and then a pandemic in June, only to rescind both in August as the outbreak was .
WHO was criticized afterwards for . This then may have impacted the delay in declaring the Ebola outbreak in West Africa as a PHEIC in 2014, long after it became a major crisis. WHO’s former legal counsel has suggested the PHEIC — and other aspects of the IHR framework — may not be effective in stimulating appropriate actions by governments .
When the time is right to evaluate lessons about the response, it might be appropriate to consider the relative effectiveness of the PHEIC and pandemic announcements and their optimal timing in stimulating appropriate action by governments. The effectiveness of lockdowns in reducing the overall death toll also needs investigation.

Coronavirus Risks Worsening a Food Crisis in the Sahel and West Africa,UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/coronavirus-risks-worsening-food-crisis-sahel-and-west-africa,Expert Comment,"In responding to the spread of the coronavirus, the governments of the Sahel and West Africa will need to draw on their collective experience of strategic coordination in emergency planning, and work together to prioritize the flow of food across borders.
The COVID-19 pandemic has struck the Sahel and West Africa at a time when the region is already under severe pressure from violent insecurity and the effects of climate change on its land, food and water resources.
By the end of April, there had been , with the highest overall numbers recorded in Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal, Niger and Burkina Faso. Low testing rates mean than these numbers give only a partial picture.
The Food Crisis Prevention Network (RPCA) forecast in early April that , more than double the number in an average year. The combined impact of violent insecurity and COVID-19 could put more than 50 million other people across the region at risk of food and nutrition crisis.
The effects of the collapse in global commodity prices, currency depreciations, rising costs of consumer goods and disruptions to supply chains are rippling across the region. And for major oil-exporting countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, Chad and Cameroon, the wipe-out of foreign currency earnings will hammer government revenues just as the cost of food and other critical imports goes up. It is likely that the number of people who suffer the direct health impact of the coronavirus will be far outstripped by the number for whom there will be harsh social and economic costs.
In recent years, valuable protocols and capacities have been put in place by governments in West and Central Africa in response to Ebola and other infectious disease outbreaks.
But inadequate healthcare funding and infrastructure across this region compound the challenge of responding to the spread of the COVID-19 infection – which is testing the resources of even the world’s best-funded public health systems.
Over many years, however, the region has steadily built up structures to tackle humanitarian and development challenges, particularly as regards food security. It has an established system for assessing the risk of food crisis annually and coordinating emergency support to vulnerable communities. Each country monitors climate and weather patterns, transhumance, market systems and agricultural statistics, and terrorist disruption of agricultural productivity, from local community to national and regional level.
The system is coordinated and quality-controlled, using common technical data standards, by the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS), a regional intergovernmental body established in 1973 in response to a devastating drought. Collective risk assessments allow emergency support to be mobilized through the RPCA.
For almost three months already, countries in Sahelian West Africa have been working with the World Health Organization to prepare national COVID-19 response strategies and strengthen health controls at their borders. Almost all governments have also opted for domestic curfews, and variations of lockdown and market restrictions.
 in rapidly developing Africa’s diagnostic capacity, and plans are under way to .  to develop a , to which . While the IMF has agreed emergency financial assistance to help countries address the urgent balance-of-payments, health and social programme needs linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, signing off $3.4 billion for Nigeria, $442 million for Senegal and $130 million for Mauritania.
Steps are also now being taken towards the formulation of a more joined-up regional approach. Notably, Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari has been  to coordinate the regional response to COVID-19. As Africa’s biggest economy and home to its largest population, Nigeria is a critical hub for transnational flows of goods and people. Its controversial August 2019 land border closure, in a bid to address smuggling, has already painfully disrupted regional agri-food trade and value chains. The active engagement of the Buhari administration will thus be crucial to the success of a multifaceted regional response.
One of the first tough questions the region’s governments must collectively address is how long to maintain the border shutdowns that were imposed as an initial measure to curb the spread of the virus. Closed borders are detrimental to food security, and disruptive to supply chains and the livelihoods of micro, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs that rely on cross-border trade. The impact of prolonged closures will be all the more profound in a region where welfare systems are largely non-existent or, at best, highly precarious.
Nigeria, in particular, with more than 95 million people already living in extreme poverty, might do well to explore measures to avoid putting food further beyond the reach of people who are seeing their purchasing power evaporate.
In taking further actions to control the spread of the coronavirus, the region’s governments will need to show faith in the system that they have painstakingly developed to monitor and respond to the annual risk of food crisis across the Sahel. This system, and the critical data it offers, will be vital to informing interventions to strengthen the four components of food security – availability, access, stability and utilization – in the context of COVID-19, and for charting a post-pandemic path of recovery.
Above all, careful steps will need to be put in place to ensure that preventing the spread of the coronavirus does not come at the cost of even greater food insecurity for the people of the Sahel and West Africa. The region’s governments must prioritize the flow of food across borders and renew their commitment to strategic coordination and alignment.

"Coronavirus Vaccine: Available For All, or When it's Your Turn?",UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/coronavirus-vaccine-available-all-or-when-its-your-turn,Expert Comment,"Despite high-level commitments and pledges to cooperate to ensure equitable global access to a coronavirus vaccine, prospects for fair distribution are uncertain.
When the H1N1 influenza pandemic struck in 2009, some industrialized countries were well prepared. Many countries’ preparedness plans had focused on preparing for an influenza pandemic and based on earlier alerts over the H5N1 ‘bird flu’ virus, countries had made advanced purchase or ‘sleeping’ contracts for vaccine supplies that could be activated as soon as a pandemic was declared. Countries without contracts scrambled to get supplies after those that already had contracts received their vaccine.
Following the 2009 pandemic, the European Union (EU) developed plans for joint-purchase vaccine contracts that any member state could join, guaranteeing the same price per dose for everyone. In 2009, low-income countries were unable to get the vaccine until manufacturers agreed to let 10 per cent of their production go to the World Health Organization (WHO).
The situation for COVID-19 could be even worse. No country had a sleeping contract in place for a COVID-19 vaccine since nobody had anticipated that the next pandemic would be a coronavirus, not an influenza virus. With around 80 candidate vaccines reported to be in development, choosing the right one will be like playing roulette.
These candidates will be whittled down as some will fail at an early stage of development and others will not get to scale-up for manufacturing. All of the world’s major vaccine pharmaceutical companies have said that they will divert resources to manufacture COVID-19 vaccines and, as long as they choose the right candidate for production, they have the expertise and the capacity to produce in huge quantities.
Our game now changes from roulette to a horse race, as the probability of winning is a matter of odds not a random chance. Countries are now able to try to make contracts alone or in purchasing consortia with other states, and with one of the major companies or with multiple companies. This would be like betting on one of the favourites.
For example, it has been reported that Oxford University has made an agreement with pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, with a possibility of 100 million doses being available by the end of 2020. If the vaccine works and those doses materialize, and are all available for the UK, then the UK population requirements will be met in full, and the challenge becomes vaccinating everyone as quickly as possible.
Even if half of the doses were reserved for the UK, all those in high-risk or occupational groups could be vaccinated rapidly. However, as each major manufacturer accepts more contracts, the quantity that each country will get diminishes and the time to vaccinate the at-risk population gets longer.
At this point, it is not known how manufacturers will respond to requests for vaccine and how they will apportion supplies between different markets. You could bet on an outsider. You study the field and select a biotech that has potential with a good production development programme and a tie-in with a smaller-scale production facility.
If other countries do not try to get contracts, you will get your vaccine as fast as manufacturing can be scaled up; but because it is a small manufacturer, your supplies may take a long time. And outsiders do not often win races. You can of course, depending on your resources, cover several runners and try to make multiple contracts. However, you take on the risk that some will fail, and you may have compromised your eventual supply.
On April 24, the WHO co-hosted a meeting with the president of France, the president of the European Commission and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It brought together heads of state and industry leaders who committed to ‘work towards equitable global access based on an unprecedented level of partnership’. They agreed ‘to create a strong unified voice, to build on past experience and to be accountable to the world, to communities and to one another’ for vaccines, testing materials and treatments.
They did not, however, say how this will be achieved and the absence of the United States was notable. The EU and its partners are hosting an international pledging conference on May 4 that aims to raise €7.5 billion in initial funding to kick-start global cooperation on vaccines. Co-hosts will be France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Norway and Saudi Arabia and the priorities will be ‘Test, Treat and Prevent’, with the latter dedicated to vaccines.
Despite these expressions of altruism, every government will face the tension between wanting to protect their own populations as quickly as possible and knowing that this will disadvantage poorer countries, where health services are even less able to cope. It will not be a vote winner to offer a share in available vaccine to less-privileged countries.
The factories for the biggest vaccine manufacturers are in Europe, the US and India. Will European manufacturers be obliged by the EU to restrict sales first to European countries? Will the US invoke its Defense Production Act and block vaccine exports until there are stocks enough for every American? And will vaccine only be available in India for those who can afford it?
The lessons on vaccine availability from the 2009 influenza pandemic are clear: vaccine was not shared on anything like an equitable basis. It remains to be seen if we will do any better in 2020.

Algeria’s Perfect Storm: COVID-19 and Its Fallout,UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/algeria-s-perfect-storm-covid-19-and-its-fallout,Expert Comment,"Coronavirus is a godsend for Algeria’s government to introduce restrictive measures beyond those needed to contain COVID-19. But its new leaders are missing a chance to gain legitimacy, which will offset the socio-economic fallout of the drop in oil prices.
Although protests successfully ended Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s 20-year sultanistic rule a little over one year ago, demands have been continuing to dismantle the system, get rid of the old personnel, and institute democracy.
The controversial election in December of Abdelmadjid Tebboune — who has inherited a disastrous situation — has not tempered the determination of the Hirak protest movement. As a former minister and prime minister under Bouteflika, the new president has won little legitimacy, and protests have continued.
Now COVID-19 is worsening already dire economic conditions, such as a sharp drop in oil prices. By the beginning of May, statistics showed 10% of confirmed cases have ended in fatality, the highest percentage in the region.
Hirak had already called for the suspension of the marches — mobilising online instead — before the government’s measures, which include curfews and lockdowns, demonstrating a high sense of duty. But instead of appeasing Hirak’s demands, the government has maintained the authoritarian style of its predecessors.
Tebboune released more than 5,000 prisoners on March 31 but . It even passed a , and may be used to justify actions against journalists.
The regime wishes to see an end to the Hirak, and rejects .
Tebboune’s actions contradict his  and his promises of instituting the rule of law. In proclaiming the measures, the government has shown disappointing leadership, acting in an authoritarian fashion.
Tebboune also declared proudly that Algeria was fully prepared to fight the coronavirus epidemic, an optimistic claim given the country has only 400 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, or one per 100,000 people. Despite hundreds of billions of hydrocarbon dollars accumulating during the Bouteflika-era, Algeria’s health system ranks 173 out of 195 countries.
Algerians often refer to hospitals as ‘mouroirs’, meaning ‘places for the dying’. Not only has the state failed to build modern hospitals but basic hygienic conditions are lacking, and government officials prefer being treated overseas. A 2014 project to build five university hospitals was abandoned, leaving the health sector in deplorable shape.
Before Chinese assistance arrived, the glaring lack of equipment to protect caregivers and care for the sick was evident. Prime Minister Abdelaziz Djerad . The president recently stated Algeria’s doctors are among the  but didn't address why .
Strict containment measures are in sync with most countries but implementation is challenging when most people live in overcrowded urban dwellings (the average household consists of 5.9 members).
Water shortages in many areas makes good hygiene and decontamination impossible, while schools and universities find online teaching difficult when many students do not possess laptops or internet connections. And only 20% of Algerians have debit cards in a cash-dominated economy because of low trust in the public-dominated banking sector, making online shopping capability low.
An already declining macroeconomic situation is worsening due to COVID-19. The IMF revised its 2020 estimates for Algeria, forecasting a catastrophic contraction of -5.2% in a country where hydrocarbons account for 93% of export revenues and 60% of its budget.
Foreign currency reserves are now an estimated $55 billion (expected to fall to $44billion by the end of 2020), down from $200 billion in 2014, and Algerian crude has recently traded close to production costs, with .
In line with its historic aversion to external borrowing, Tebboune recently , as he argued such borrowing undermines sovereign foreign policy because - when indebted - ‘we cannot talk about either Palestine or Western Sahara’, two causes dear to Algeria. ‘Friendly countries’ - most likely a reference to China - are said to have offered to grant loans which have been declined for now.
The government is forecasted to face a 20% budget shortfall this year, but Algeria’s fiscal response to COVID-19 is actually the largest among the regional hydrocarbon exporters at an estimated 8% of GDP, compared to an average of 3.2%. However, the government  (a second cut in a month, from an initial 30% reduction), halting state projects and slashing its $41 billion import bill by 25% while expanding agricultural production. National oil company SONATRACH will also cut planned investment by half to $7 billion but plans have been revealed to develop other natural resources including gold, uranium and phosphates.
But recent growth rates are insufficient to create jobs for those entering the labour market. Despite government attempts to support a rather anaemic ‘formal’ private sector, estimates are 700,000 jobs could be lost due to potential bankruptcies from reduced activity and a loss of markets abroad.
Facing potential social unrest and the quasi-preservation of a tired social contract, the government has committed to upholding public sector wages - including for 50% of the civil servants told to stay home - protecting sacrosanct, unsustainable subsidies, and increasing health expenditure to strengthen the capacity to combat COVID-19.

So COVID-19 has not created new problems, it has merely magnified and exacerbated the numerous inequalities and failures of the Bouteflika regime to sufficiently invest in  (economic, food, health environmental, personal, community, and political). Typically, whenever oil prices and related earnings dwindle, the political system promises to reform and diversify the economy. Tebboune is repeating this same old tune.
There are positive elements, such as the government’s realization it must initiate genuine reforms. And local enterprises have been successfully producing artificial respirators, surgical masks, and other materials. Algerians, including the Hirak, are showing great social solidarity.
But the government must capitalize on these positive actions by introducing real change. Because, if not, Hirak will certainly be back in force once the crisis is over, and operating in an environment of worsening socioeconomic problems. The medicine of the past will not work.

COVID-19 Crisis – Business as Usual for Gaza?,UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/covid-19-crisis-business-usual-gaza,Expert Comment,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges, economic collapse and strict lockdowns in many parts of the world. For the people of Gaza, this reality is nothing new.
In August 2012, when the UN released its report , they could not have imagined what the world would look like in 2020: cities under lockdown, restrictions on movement, border closures, widespread unemployment, economic collapse, fear and anxiety and, above all, uncertainty about what the future holds.
For Gaza’s population of 2 million people this reality is nothing new. The conditions that the rest of the world are currently experiencing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is similar to the tight blockade Gaza has been living under ever since Hamas took over in 2007. Israel has imposed severe restrictions on the movement of people and goods, youth unemployment has reached 60 per cent, and over 80 per cent of Gaza’s population are now dependent on international aid.
The people of Gaza are having to face the COVID-19 crisis already at a disadvantage, with poor infrastructure, limited resources and a shortage of the most basic services, such as water and power supply. It also has a fragile health system, with hospitals lacking essential medical supplies and equipment, as well as the capacity to deal with the outbreak as there are only 84 ICU beds and ventilators available.
 
Meanwhile, intra-Palestinian divisions have persisted and were evident in the initial reaction to the pandemic. When President Mahmoud Abbas announced a state of emergency, it took two days for the Hamas-led government in Gaza to follow suit and shut down schools and universities. They later made a separate emergency appeal to address the crisis and prepare for a COVID-19 response in Gaza. This lack of coordination is typical of the way the Palestinian Authority and Hamas approach crisis situations.
After the initial uncoordinated response, Hamas, as the de-facto ruler of Gaza, has asserted its ability to control Gaza’s borders by putting in place quarantine measures for everyone who enters the strip, whether through the Erez checkpoint with Israel or the Rafah border with Egypt. They have also assigned  for all arrivals from abroad, who have to stay in quarantine for 21 days. In comparison, there are 20 quarantine centres in the West Bank.  These strict measures have prevented the spread of the virus in the community and confined it to the quarantine centres, with only  as of 6 May. Gaza’s de-facto authorities have also been able to monitor markets and prices to ensure the availability of essential goods.
Faced with a major crisis, Al-Qassam Brigades – the armed wing of Hamas – have tried to play the role of a national army by participating in efforts to fight the pandemic. They have relatively good logistical capacity and have contributed to  with a total capacity of 1,000 units to prepare for more arrivals into Gaza. At the local level,  in addition to disseminating information about the virus and related preventative and protective measures. Other precautionary measures put in place include closing the weekly open markets, and restricting social gatherings like weddings and funerals.
Despite COVID-19, it’s business as usual when it comes to international dealings with Gaza. The key parties in the conflict – Israel, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority – along with the main external actors – Egypt, the United Nations and Qatar – have continued to stick to their policies aimed at keeping the security situation under control and preventing further escalation. Although Israel has allowed entry of pharmaceutical supplies and medical equipment into Gaza during the pandemic, it has kept its restrictions on the movement of goods and people in place, while keeping a close eye on the development of the COVID-19 outbreak in Gaza – a major outbreak here would be a nightmare scenario for Israel.
Meanwhile, Qatar has continued to address the humanitarian and economic needs of Gaza in an attempt to ease the pressure and prevent further escalation. It has pledged $150 million over the next six months to help families in Gaza from poorer backgrounds. Gaza has also been discussed by the Middle East Quartet, as Nickolay Mladenov, the UN special coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process,  during a call with the members of the Quartet.
Amid the pandemic,. The Israeli defence minister, Naftali Bennett, requested that in return for providing humanitarian aid to Gaza, Hamas agrees to return the remains of two Israeli soldiers killed in the 2014 war. While openly rejecting Bennett's statement, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, has offered to move forward with a prisoner swap deal if Israel agrees to release elderly prisoners and detainees in addition to detained women and children. Though dealing with its own COVID-19 outbreak, Egypt has started to mediate between the two parties in an attempt to stabilize the situation and reach a prisoner swap deal.
In the wake of this pandemic, lessons should be learned and policies should be examined, by all parties. Firstly, Israel should re-evaluate its security measures towards Gaza by easing restrictions on movement and trade which would have a positive impact on living conditions for Gaza’s population. The current measures have proven to be unsustainable and have contributed to the endless cycle of violence. Secondly, the intra-Palestinian division should end, to save Palestinians from contradictory policies and insufficient capacity on both sides. In fact, all previous attempts have failed to end this self-destructive division and this is due to the absence of political will on both sides. Elections seem to be the only viable path towards unity. Finally, efforts by the international community should go beyond stabilizing the security situation and ongoing crisis inside Gaza, where disruption of normal life is the norm.
While the world has reacted to this pandemic with a whole host of new policies and emergency measures, it has remained business as usual when dealing with Gaza. Should COVID-19 spread in Gaza, its people – who have already paid the price of a continuous blockade and intra-Palestinian division for 13 years – will pay a heavy price yet again. However, this time it is not a crisis that they alone will have to face.
",2020/5/6,Mohammed Abdalfatah,Chatham House,,,COVID-19 Crisis – Business as Usual for Gaza?,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges, economic collapse and strict lockdowns in many parts of the world. For the people of Gaza, this reality is nothing new.
In August 2012, when the UN released its report , they could not have imagined what the world would look like in 2020: cities under lockdown, restrictions on movement, border closures, widespread unemployment, economic collapse, fear and anxiety and, above all, uncertainty about what the future holds.
For Gaza’s population of 2 million people this reality is nothing new. The conditions that the rest of the world are currently experiencing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is similar to the tight blockade Gaza has been living under ever since Hamas took over in 2007. Israel has imposed severe restrictions on the movement of people and goods, youth unemployment has reached 60 per cent, and over 80 per cent of Gaza’s population are now dependent on international aid.
The people of Gaza are having to face the COVID-19 crisis already at a disadvantage, with poor infrastructure, limited resources and a shortage of the most basic services, such as water and power supply. It also has a fragile health system, with hospitals lacking essential medical supplies and equipment, as well as the capacity to deal with the outbreak as there are only 84 ICU beds and ventilators available.
 
Meanwhile, intra-Palestinian divisions have persisted and were evident in the initial reaction to the pandemic. When President Mahmoud Abbas announced a state of emergency, it took two days for the Hamas-led government in Gaza to follow suit and shut down schools and universities. They later made a separate emergency appeal to address the crisis and prepare for a COVID-19 response in Gaza. This lack of coordination is typical of the way the Palestinian Authority and Hamas approach crisis situations.
After the initial uncoordinated response, Hamas, as the de-facto ruler of Gaza, has asserted its ability to control Gaza’s borders by putting in place quarantine measures for everyone who enters the strip, whether through the Erez checkpoint with Israel or the Rafah border with Egypt. They have also assigned  for all arrivals from abroad, who have to stay in quarantine for 21 days. In comparison, there are 20 quarantine centres in the West Bank.  These strict measures have prevented the spread of the virus in the community and confined it to the quarantine centres, with only  as of 6 May. Gaza’s de-facto authorities have also been able to monitor markets and prices to ensure the availability of essential goods.
Faced with a major crisis, Al-Qassam Brigades – the armed wing of Hamas – have tried to play the role of a national army by participating in efforts to fight the pandemic. They have relatively good logistical capacity and have contributed to  with a total capacity of 1,000 units to prepare for more arrivals into Gaza. At the local level,  in addition to disseminating information about the virus and related preventative and protective measures. Other precautionary measures put in place include closing the weekly open markets, and restricting social gatherings like weddings and funerals.

"COVID-19 in South Africa: Leadership, Resilience and Inequality",UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/covid-19-south-africa-leadership-resilience-and-inequality,Expert Comment,"In a world looking for leadership, South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa has been remarkable. One year after he carried the time-worn ANC through a national election, South Africans are crying out for more.
In the COVID-19 crisis so far, Cyril Ramaphosa has been widely praised for displaying the decisive leadership so many hoped for when they cast their ballot for him in May 2019. Buttressed by others such as health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize, and on a simple objective to prevent transmission, South Africa has been a lesson to the world. Act fast. Act hard.
Former president Thabo Mbeki’s disastrous response to the HIV crisis cast a long shadow over his legacy, and Ramaphosa has taken note. South Africa has had one of the tightest lockdowns in the world. No exercise. No cigarettes. No alcohol.
The lockdown was imposed when the country had only around 1,000 recorded cases and just two deaths. As a result, transmission from returning travellers has not yet led to an exponential infection rate within the community. The government’s swift reaction has bought much needed time with the peak now seemingly delayed to September or October.
Ramaphosa has also emerged as a key focal point for Africa-wide responses. As current chair of the African Union (AU) he leads the continental engagement with the World Health Organization (WHO), and the various international finance institutions, while South African officials are working with the AU and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) on a push for African debt restructuring.
He has also been active in trouble shooting to unlock external assistance to the continent, including from China and Russia. Appointing special envoys is typical of his boardroom-honed leadership style.
International and regional partnerships are vital for resilience and the arrival of 217 Cuban doctors to South Africa is strongly reminiscent of the liberationist solidarity of the Cold War era. And regional economies remain dependent on South Africa to protect their own vulnerable citizens. Following the 2008 financial crisis, it was South Africa’s regional trading relationships that remained robust, while trade with its main global partners in China and the US dropped.
Despite the plaudits, Ramaphosa remains vulnerable to challenge at home, notably around his failure to stimulate South Africa’s moribund economy. On the eve of lockdown, Moody’s joined its peers Standard and Poor’s and Fitch in giving South Africa a below investment grade credit rating. The move was a long time coming. Long mooted economic reforms were slow to materialise, and South Africa had fallen into recession.
Ramaphosa depends on a small core of close advisors and allies, initially united in apparent opposition to the kleptocratic rule of President Jacob Zuma and the deep patronage networks he created within both the party and the state. But this allegiance is being tested by economic reality. Support within the party was already drifting prior to the crisis.
Disagreements are not just technocratic – there are big ideological questions in play around the role of the state in the economy, the level of intervention, and its affordability, with key government figures sceptical of rapid market reforms. Energy minister and former union stalwart Gwede Mantashe is wary of job losses, and minister of public enterprises Pravin Gordhan protective of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Before coronavirus hit, Ramaphosa seemed content to allow these policy disputes to play themselves out with little decisive intervention.
Slow progress on reform, against worsening economic performance, left Ramaphosa and his allies exposed. In January the president missed the UK’s African Investment Summit in order to assert control over a party meeting at which it was expected his detractors would seek to remove Gordhan.
As the independently assertive - and eminently quotable - pro-market reformist finance minister Tito Mboweni stated, ‘you can’t eat ideology’. Accelerated reform and restructuring is required if the government turns to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for assistance.
For the first time, Gordhan has been forced to deny a bailout to beleaguered state airline South African Airways (SAA), and the government’s lockdown bailout of R500 billion has been applauded by business. Much like the fiscal stimulus and recovery plan of 2018, it relies on smart spending, targeting sectors with high multiplier effects. It also includes significant reserve bank loans.
But it has been criticised for not doing enough to help the most vulnerable. There is considerable fear of what could happen when the virus takes hold in South Africa’s townships and informal settlements where social distancing is almost impossible, basic toilet facilities are shared, and HIV and TB rates high.
There are mounting concerns of the humanitarian cost of a prolonged lockdown, and the government has been faster than others in implementing a tiered lockdown system, trying to get people back to work and keep the economy afloat.
South Africa has been criticized by the UN for the use of lethal force by security forces in enforcing lockdown and, in a society plagued by corruption, there are fears legislation to stop the spread of false information could be used to restrict legitimate reporting on the virus response or other issues.
COVID-19 shines a spotlight on societies’ fault-lines worldwide. South Africa is often touted as having one of the highest levels of inequality in the world but, in a globalized economy, these divisions are international as much as they are local.
Resilience comes from within, but also depends on regional and global trading and financial systems. South Africans and international partners have long recognised Ramaphosa’s leadership qualities as an impressive voice for the global south.
But he must also be an advocate for South Africa’s poor. This crisis could accelerate implementation of his landmark pro-poor National Health Insurance and Universal Health Care programmes. Or the hit of COVID-19 on top of South Africa’s existing economic woes could see them derailed entirely. Ramaphosa must push through economic reforms at the same time as managing COVID-19 and rebuilding trust in his government.

Coronavirus: Could a People’s Bailout Help?,UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/coronavirus-could-people-s-bailout-help,Expert Comment,"The coronavirus crisis has resulted in an unprecedented economic downturn. Conventional quantitative easing measures used after the 2008 financial crisis will not be enough this time.

Quantitative easing (QE) has been in existence since the Japanese central bank introduced it at the turn of the millennium. The simplest way to think about it is this: when interest rates can't go down anymore and play their normal role of stimulating growth, central banks try to expand the money supply. So, they're expanding the quantitative amount of money they put into the system. 
Of course, after 2008 because of the scale of the financial and economic collapse, many Western countries resorted to QE. Some have never gotten rid of it. Others have started to, but as a result of this crisis, have gone straight back to that playbook.

It is incredible to reflect back on the short time since I published that piece. I entitled it the need for a so-called people's QE, and in some ways a number of European countries, including the UK, have executed some aspects of what I was suggesting. 
The United States has not, even though the absolute amounts of money the US authorities have put through their fiscal system to try and support the economy is actually bigger as a percentage of GDP than many in Europe. 
What they haven't done is support ongoing employment through various schemes that many European countries have done, of which the UK has, to some degree, been one of the most ambitious.
That’s partly why you see such enormous filing for unemployment claims in the US. There’s no direct support to encourage employers to keep their employees on, in complete contrast to what you see in many Scandinavian countries who were the first to do it in Europe, and something the UK has since done. 

We are living in an extraordinary time. Like many others in my generation, it’s nothing that any of us have gone through. Perhaps economically, the only parallel one can find is from the 1920s and 1930s.
It became obvious to me in early March that governments are going to have to essentially force as many of us as possible, if we weren't doing absolutely crucial necessities, to stop working or to work from home. It was pretty obvious that the consequences could be horrific. 
So, the idea of a people's QE that I suggested then, some would have regarded as quite audacious. The most dramatic thing that could be done was, to put it simply, governments effectively pay for every business and every employee to have a two month paid holiday. Obviously, this would cost a very large amount of money for governments, but it would be the least disruptive way of getting us all to stay home.
And when the time is right to start letting us get back to anything vaguely like normality, there wouldn't be as much permanent disruption. I think about six weeks have passed since I wrote that piece. Actually, given the policies many governments have announced, I'm not sure undertaking the audacity in generosity of what I suggested would have cost any more. Over the long term, it might have actually turned out to be less. 
Of course, there are ethics issues around whether the system could be gamed or not, amongst other issues. But six weeks later, I still believe that would have been the smartest thing to do. It certainly would have been much better than trying to encourage many businesses, particularly smaller ones, to take out loans.
A couple of countries got close to what I was suggesting – Germany and Switzerland were very quick to give 100% government guarantees to business, as well as generous wage support systems. But a number of other countries haven't, like the US, even though they wrote a $1200 check for each citizen. 

I think these things might have to be considered. I remember being on a conference call to Chatham House members where we discussed what would be the likely economic consequences and what policymakers should do. One person on the call was talking about quite conventional forms of policy just through various forms of standard QE. 
During the Q&A, someone asked whether we thought the US Federal Reserve might end up buying equities. And I said, well, why not? Eventually, it might come to that. 
Actually, before that discussion was over, the Fed coincidentally announced they were going to buy high-yield corporate bonds, or very risky company debt. This is something that would have been unheard of even by the playbook of 2008. 
So, I don't think ideas like a kind of provision to help student debtors is entirely crazy. These are things that our policymakers are going to have to think about as we go forward in the challenging and unpredictable days and weeks ahead. 

Going one step further than a people’s QE and postponing major payments is a pretty interesting concept. I think in reality, it would be very disruptive to the medium to long-term mechanism of our societies. It could be very, very complicated. 
But, of course, some parts of the G20 nations, including the UK, have moved significantly in these areas as it relates to rent payments or mortgage payments. There have been significant mortgage holidays being introduced for many sectors of our community. I think the British government has been quite thoughtful about it without doing the whole hog of potentially getting rid of our transaction system for two months or beyond.
You know, this may well be something that has to be considered if, God forbid, there is a second peak of the virus. If countries come out of a lockdown and all that results in is a dramatic rise in infections and then death again, we're going to end up right back where we are. Policymakers may have to implement more generous versions of what we've done already, despite what the long term debt consequences could be.

The speed at which many countries have responded and introduced policies means that there's going to be some gaping holes which allow people to unfairly benefit from the system. And if indeed, that were to be the case, I cannot see why a hedge fund should benefit from government generosity.
A true hedge fund is supposed to be a form of investment manager that thrives in times of great volatility, and knows how to better navigate such financial markets than more conventional funds. So this shouldn’t be an environment where hedge funds seek the same kind of help as small businesses. That is certainly something the government should be very careful about.

In my view, an effective central bank has to do whatever is necessary, including doing very unconventional things, when the society in which that central bank operates needs it. 
Most of the time, central banks are pretty boring places, but they really become crucial organizations when we go through times like the 1920s, 1930s, 2008, and of course, this current crisis. If they want to maintain their legitimacy, whatever the true parliamentary or congressional legal standing is, they have to do things quickly and as we've seen in this case, differently than the convention in order to do what our societies need. 
Somebody was asking me just last week whether the Fed buying high grade debt was legal or not. I think that’s a pretty irrelevant conversation because if it’s not legal now, it will be made legal tomorrow. So, I think central banks have to keep their legitimacy and they have to do what is necessary when the time requires it. In that sense, I think most central banks have handled this crisis so far pretty well.

"In the COVID-19 Era, Healthcare Should be Universal and Free",UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/covid-19-era-healthcare-should-be-universal-and-free,Expert Comment,"Coronavirus is the ultimate example of why we need universal health coverage because, if anyone is left out, it threatens the health security of everyone.
COVID-19 is a universal threat against the health and wellbeing of all of us and therefore requires universal protective measures. Our best hope is to develop an effective vaccine, which logically should be given to everyone, to stop future outbreaks spreading and potentially eradicate the disease.
But, for the foreseeable future, as the virus spreads around the world and there is potential for people to be reinfected, this disease remains a threat to all of humanity. So, with such a deadly disease ever-present and able to flare up quickly, it is in all our interests that there is truly universal access to a full range of health services needed to tackle the disease.
This doesn’t mean just the high-profile, intensive-care hospital services required to save the lives of people with severe illness. It also includes the vital public health services needed to stop the spread of the virus, including testing, contact tracing and isolating cases.
In addition, everyone must heed the health promotion messages concerning handwashing and physical distancing. And there should also be universal access to compassionate palliative care for people who succumb to the virus.
If the objective is to guarantee universal access to healthcare, it is vital to eliminate barriers that inhibit people accessing services and one obvious place to start is to remove financial barriers ― services should be publicly financed and provided free of charge.
Worldwide it has been shown that healthcare user fees dramatically reduce demand for health services ― especially preventive services because people may not perceive that they need interventions. When a $0.30 charge for preventive de-worming medicines was introduced for schoolchildren in Kenya, demand fell 80%. Conversely, when countries have removed user fees, such as when the UK launched the National Health Service in 1948, they have witnessed huge increases in demand for services.
But regrettably high user fees are common in many developing countries, where up to three-quarters of healthcare expenditure is in the form of out-of-pocket payments. Furthermore, in countries with weak governance systems, some impoverished patients are detained in hospital for months until their families can pay their bills. In addition to this being a flagrant human rights abuse, it represents a wasteful use of vital hospital beds as demand from COVID-19 patients is set to rise.
 ― not a sensible policy in the midst of a pandemic. Retaining health service user fees is, therefore, likely to reduce a country’s capacity to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, as infection rates rise because of poorer people forgoing testing and treatment.
In particular, people are highly unlikely to comply with isolation or quarantine regulations in hospitals if they face mounting hospital bills. It is, therefore, encouraging that .
The policy solution to this situation is simple. Countries should remove all user fees in public health facilities and replace lost revenue and meet rising demand for services with higher levels of public financing.
This can be accomplished surprisingly quickly, even in low-income settings, as shown by Uganda in 2001 when President Yoweri Museveni abolished all health service user fees ― ten days before a presidential election. As a result, healthcare consumption doubled practically overnight and World Bank research showed that the poor benefited disproportionately.
In providing a universal entitlement to free services, it will be important that this policy be extended beyond coronavirus-specific services because, if people suspect they have the virus but are then charged because they are diagnosed with malaria or another disease, they will be discouraged from returning.
It is also important to recognise that guaranteeing access to free services in the public sector does not necessarily mean that private providers must also provide free care. In countries with a universal free public system, it is common for richer members of society to self-select out and pay in the private sector, which improves the targeting of public subsidies on the poor. This has been crucial to the success of universal health systems in Sri Lanka and Thailand, which are weathering COVID-19 relatively well.
Healthcare user fees have been a highly contentious topic in global health since the 1980s when they were imposed on many developing countries through the structural adjustment policies of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It is therefore very significant that, as part of its COVID-19 policy responses, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has now explicitly called on countries to remove all healthcare user fees and co-payments.
This is a radical change in position from the days when it . That programme encouraged community-based financing - such as establishing revolving drug funds - which in effect meant poor people having to pay for their medicines out of their own pocket.
And these issues are also highly relevant to South Africa’s response to COVID-19 and its long term plans to reform its health sector. After the first case was detected on March 4, the government acted quickly and decisively in implementing a national lockdown and mobilising a mass testing programme, involving 28,000 community health workers and 67 mobile laboratories.
These services were made available to everyone free of charge. This universal, free primary-care approach was singled out for praise at the WHO daily press briefing and described as 'incredible' by the epidemiologist leading the global fight against COVID-19.
At the same time stories were emerging from the United States that people were being charged more than $3,000 for tests, or being charged high fees for telephone consultations with their doctors which, not surprisingly, was discouraging people from being tested.
These successes also have implications for longer-term health financing policies in South Africa. In particular, the superior performance of universal tax-financing over private US-style financing through user fees and private insurance would appear to vindicate the government’s long-term goal to achieve universal health coverage through its National Health Insurance programme currently being debated by parliament.
It would appear that, faced with the universal threat of COVID-19, South Africa and the world is realising that it is in nobody’s interest to exclude poor people from accessing health services through charging user fees ― which, in effect, are a tax on the sick.
Instead, if we are all to be protected, we must publicly finance our health systems and provide services free at the point of delivery ― for everyone. This will be an essential step in living with the ongoing threat of coronavirus, and in achieving the long-term sustainable development goal target of universal health coverage.

COVID-19 Will Reshape Our Relationship with the State,UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/covid-19-will-reshape-our-relationship-state,Expert Comment,"Although it is not yet known how coronavirus impacts on politics, it will almost certainly fundamentally reshape the relationship between citizen and state.

Coronavirus: Nigeria’s ‘Fiscal Flu’,UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/coronavirus-nigeria-s-fiscal-flu,Expert Comment,"Beyond the immediate concerns of containing the spread of COVID-19, Nigeria’s greatest challenge — a fiscal crisis of historic proportions — is beginning to unfold.

Temptations Abound as COVID-19 Drives Need for Private Data,UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/temptations-abound-covid-19-drives-need-private-data,Expert Comment,"Contact tracing apps highlight the importance of combining both technical privacy fixes and a grounding in the international human rights framework.
There is a legitimate fear that the  and other technologies to slow the spread of COVID-19 could tip the balance in the , presenting a major challenge for policymakers, technology companies, and the human rights community.
The key issues are what level of intrusion into privacy is acceptable for rapidly developed data-driven responses to the COVID crisis, and who decides? In the short term, technical fixes are key to limiting the risks, but legal and other safeguards remain critical during the current crisis and beyond.
Under international law, , interference with the right to privacy can only take place in limited circumstances where there is a legitimate aim.
Importantly, this may include some measures that aim to protect public health. But governments must ensure that any interference with privacy, such as collecting personal data on a government-authorized app, is .
As a general rule, the greater the intrusion into people’s private lives and other potential human rights impacts when doing so, the higher the burden on states to establish (and continue to prove) they are necessary.  are expected to be .
If there is wide use of smartphones in a country, contact tracing apps may be seen as less restrictive than lockdown - a legitimate factor in deciding whether to adopt an app. However, apps can also present an unacceptable intrusion into private lives if they collect personal data but . Apps may speed up the process of tracing who has the virus and who it spreads to, but high levels of testing, traditional contact tracing, advice and support are also needed.
Even where public health interest can be shown, if there are significant risks that data will be abused or other data security risks, then the . This has prompted efforts to design apps to reduce privacy and security risks, such as minimizing what data is collected (for example offering options to collect non-location data), and anonymizing and encrypting data.
There are also efforts to de-centralize contact tracing apps.  deploys Low-Energy Bluetooth capacity, which can support how apps capture anonymized contact points function, saving the energy needed for the app to ‘run’ in the background.
Under this model, any anonymized data exchanged between phones to identify contacts stays at the phone level so . Apple and Google also indicate their terms of service require that apps are voluntary, are not used for non-coronavirus goals, and that functionality will be removed on a regional basis when no longer needed.
The conditions for using Apple and Google’s proposed functions appear laudable.  and, under pressure from civil society, are increasingly mindful of privacy and data protection concerns; they also have experience of managing vastly different regulatory and policy approaches in countries.
However, the terms of use also highlight the limits of technical solutions. Not all states will opt to use Apple and Google’s decentralized model or terms for Low-Energy Bluetooth functionality. India plans to make its app mandatory in some workplaces and on transport, and it is harder for a mandatory app to meet human rights standards, with the necessity for clear exemptions (an example being journalists protecting their sources) being one challenge.
Voluntary apps can also become mandatory by default if, for example, transport providers or employers require their use. If individuals, such as migrants and others entering a country, feel they have no alternative then, as with cookies on websites, they may simply accept the terms offered.
A de-centralized app may still rely on ‘risk scores’, which often uses artificial intelligence and requires careful scrutiny. If scores are overly broad or rely on symptoms reported by nearby contacts only (again where there is limited testing), they can easily become arbitrary or even discriminatory, especially if linked to advice about self-isolating or enforced quarantine measures.
Strong democratic and legal safeguards are critical.

",2020/5/15,Madeleine Forster,Chatham House,,,Temptations Abound as COVID-19 Drives Need for Private Data,"Contact tracing apps highlight the importance of combining both technical privacy fixes and a grounding in the international human rights framework.
There is a legitimate fear that the  and other technologies to slow the spread of COVID-19 could tip the balance in the , presenting a major challenge for policymakers, technology companies, and the human rights community.
The key issues are what level of intrusion into privacy is acceptable for rapidly developed data-driven responses to the COVID crisis, and who decides? In the short term, technical fixes are key to limiting the risks, but legal and other safeguards remain critical during the current crisis and beyond.
Under international law, , interference with the right to privacy can only take place in limited circumstances where there is a legitimate aim.
Importantly, this may include some measures that aim to protect public health. But governments must ensure that any interference with privacy, such as collecting personal data on a government-authorized app, is .
As a general rule, the greater the intrusion into people’s private lives and other potential human rights impacts when doing so, the higher the burden on states to establish (and continue to prove) they are necessary.  are expected to be .
If there is wide use of smartphones in a country, contact tracing apps may be seen as less restrictive than lockdown - a legitimate factor in deciding whether to adopt an app. However, apps can also present an unacceptable intrusion into private lives if they collect personal data but . Apps may speed up the process of tracing who has the virus and who it spreads to, but high levels of testing, traditional contact tracing, advice and support are also needed.
Even where public health interest can be shown, if there are significant risks that data will be abused or other data security risks, then the . This has prompted efforts to design apps to reduce privacy and security risks, such as minimizing what data is collected (for example offering options to collect non-location data), and anonymizing and encrypting data.
There are also efforts to de-centralize contact tracing apps.  deploys Low-Energy Bluetooth capacity, which can support how apps capture anonymized contact points function, saving the energy needed for the app to ‘run’ in the background.
Under this model, any anonymized data exchanged between phones to identify contacts stays at the phone level so . Apple and Google also indicate their terms of service require that apps are voluntary, are not used for non-coronavirus goals, and that functionality will be removed on a regional basis when no longer needed.
The conditions for using Apple and Google’s proposed functions appear laudable.  and, under pressure from civil society, are increasingly mindful of privacy and data protection concerns; they also have experience of managing vastly different regulatory and policy approaches in countries.
However, the terms of use also highlight the limits of technical solutions. Not all states will opt to use Apple and Google’s decentralized model or terms for Low-Energy Bluetooth functionality. India plans to make its app mandatory in some workplaces and on transport, and it is harder for a mandatory app to meet human rights standards, with the necessity for clear exemptions (an example being journalists protecting their sources) being one challenge.
Voluntary apps can also become mandatory by default if, for example, transport providers or employers require their use. If individuals, such as migrants and others entering a country, feel they have no alternative then, as with cookies on websites, they may simply accept the terms offered.
A de-centralized app may still rely on ‘risk scores’, which often uses artificial intelligence and requires careful scrutiny. If scores are overly broad or rely on symptoms reported by nearby contacts only (again where there is limited testing), they can easily become arbitrary or even discriminatory, especially if linked to advice about self-isolating or enforced quarantine measures.
Strong democratic and legal safeguards are critical. Early efforts include the Australian law which makes it unlawful for anyone - including government officials - to use data from the government- approved app for non-coronavirus contact tracing reasons, and for employers to demand their staff use the app.
This law also re-affirms the role of independent regulators, and prevents unauthorised disclosure of data outside of Australia, reflecting community concerns that a foreign company - in this case US-based Amazon Web Services - will be involved in the app’s administration.

Accelerating Innovation in Food Systems Needs Transparency and Dialogue,UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/accelerating-innovation-food-systems-needs-transparency-and-dialogue,Expert Comment,"Innovation requires a high failure rate so, while many new technologies may fail, investment in development, testing and social acceptability is crucial to the future of our food systems.
The way we grow, process and consume food — our food system — underpins human social and economic development for centuries. Innovations such as domesticating plants and animals, bread-making, the plough or the refrigerator have transformed what we grow, how we grow it, and how we prepare and consume food.
But our food system now faces its biggest ever challenge. How to feed a growing human population to avoid diet-related ill-health (through too much or too little food) but in a way that does not drive climate change or biodiversity loss.
Research on the future of our food systems has largely focused on incremental changes possible with existing technologies. But even that research finds incremental change is not enough to make our food system more sustainable while also feeding a growing global population and maintaining our ecosystems’ health. A vast and systemic transformation of our food system is required.
An international team of researchers led by CSIRO has published a new study in the journal .  with the potential to collectively transform the food system, and it outlines what is needed to make them succeed.
The innovations span the entire food value chain from production and processing to consumption and waste management. Some we are already becoming familiar with such as artificial meats, 3D printing, drones for managing agriculture, and innovations in urban production, such as ‘high-tech’ vertical farming in cities.
Others require a bigger stretch of the imagination such as cereal crops that do not need fertiliser because they take nitrogen from the air and fix it into protein, or feed for livestock produced from human sewage.
The study highlights the innovation pipeline is healthy and robust, with many start-ups emerging in the development of new technologies. But technologies alone are not transformative. The right social, economic, and political environments are needed for them to be disruptive, adoptable at scale, and able to create the positive change needed.
There are many potential benefits of the technologies identified but there are inevitable trade-offs with many other things we care about. What may be best for the climate may not be the best for biodiversity or health, and many of the impacts of new technologies are difficult to predict until they are deployed at scale.
And this applies not only to the environment and human health. Genetic modification of crops, for example, is already hotly debated in many places around the world, and there is the risk that unequal global access to costly technologies could increase inequality between people and societies. The study proposes eight interrelated social and institutional factors required to accelerate the transition towards a more sustainable food system.
Transparency is key to safeguarding against unintended negative social and environmental impacts, and appropriate policies and regulations are needed to create incentives for change and ensure benefits are distributed fairly.
And building the social trust necessary for new technologies to take flight is the foundation of transformative change. New technologies, especially more controversial ones, require investment and political support to get off the ground. But for real implementation they need public support.

As many tech entrepreneurs see clearly, successful innovation requires a high failure rate – whether the failure occurs in technology development, or social acceptability.

Democracy Delayed: COVID-19’s Effect on Latin America’s Politics,UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/democracy-delayed-covid-19-s-effect-latin-america-s-politics,Expert Comment,"Democracy is often depicted as a means to peacefully resolve political conflict and socioeconomic discontent. But what happens when that essential safety valve of elections has been closed off?
This article is not about the coronavirus.  Or at least not directly. It’s about the elections, political processes and protests in Latin America and the Caribbean that only a few months ago seemed destined to shape many countries’ democratic futures.  In Bolivia, Chile and the Dominican Republic, public health concerns over COVID-19 have forced the postponement of critical elections; in all three countries social and political upheaval preceded the delays.  
In the best of circumstances elections serve as a safety valve for political and social tensions.  What will their postponement mean as the countries feel the economic and social effects of the pandemic?
In Bolivia, a make-up presidential election has been postponed. In Chile, a plebiscite on whether and how to amend the constitution has been pushed back to 28th October.  In both of those cases, the special elections were called in the face of public protests.  In the other country to postpone elections, the Dominican Republic, the government was forced to delay presidential and legislative elections originally scheduled for 17 May to July. 
In that case too, the rescheduling came on the heels of protests; a suspicious technical meltdown in urban voting systems in the 16th February municipal elections sparked nearly two weeks of political demonstrations and forced a re-do on 25 March – which in turn forced a delay in the government’s imposing social distancing measures in response to the country’s COVID-19 outbreak.   
And in Venezuela…. well, the complete absence of predictability and the politicization of the country’s electoral commission means scheduled National Assembly elections could occur almost any time; the one thing that is sure is under the current electoral authority, the process will never meet  for free and fair elections.  
International observers had determined the 20 October presidential and legislative process in Bolivia riddled with .

In Chile, President Sebastian Piñera had called for a national referendum to potentially rewrite the constitution after months of social protests tore through the country shutting down large parts of the capital city, Santiago.  While there is  that some protesters were supported externally, from countries such as Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, the social upheaval had been brewing for years over a lack of social mobility, the unequal educational system and a closed political system marked by a constitution originally drafted in 1980 during the reign of General Augusto Pinochet.  Originally on 25th April voters were to head to the polls to answer two questions: 1) whether to amend the constitution at all and 2) how that body charged with redrafting the charter should be elected.  But on 19 March the Chilean Congress  the referendum to October 26, 2020.   
The protests petered out as Piñera declared a nationwide  on 18 March in response to the virus but the frustrations and inequities that led to them remain and continue to fester.  Whether or not a constitution rewrite could have addressed the political, social and economic demands of a majority of Chileans that led to the protests is an open question. For many Chileans, though, it was seen as a critical step with according to one  supporting the process and a majority holding the view that a new or  would improve the economy and social policies.  With now even the October vote in doubt and social distancing effectively limiting large scale peaceful demonstrations, the means for Chileans to channel their demands and push for a collective solution have become limited. 
The COVID-19  of elections in the Dominican Republican comes under a similar cloud of political and social discontent.  The demonstrations that erupted after the technical failures of the municipal elections stemmed from longstanding distrust over the government of President Danilo Medina and his party’s creeping control over the state and allegations of corruption. While the municipal elections were eventually held without incident, the larger contest of legislative and presidential elections were seen as a crucial test of Medina’s Dominican Liberation Party (PLD), with even one of its standard bearers and two-time president Leonel Fernandez, running against it under the  People’s Force (FP) party.  Up until the  delayed the balloting, the opposition candidate Luis Abinader of the Modern Revolutionary Party (PRM) had been  the governing party’s candidate, Gonzalo Castillo, with potentially enough to avoid a second round. The future of the July elections is unclear with President Medina at the end of April extending the quarantine to 17 May but the number of infections is still rising, recently to over 11,000.

Franco-German Recovery Fund will not Fix Eurozone,UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/franco-german-recovery-fund-will-not-fix-eurozone,Expert Comment,"The proposed fund to aid recovery from the coronavirus is a welcome sign of EU solidarity. But it does not do nearly enough to address the bloc’s underlying weaknesses, and is not a game changer for fiscal integration.
We don’t know yet exactly what  will be spent on, but it will likely include investment in green infrastructure, research and support for the hardest-hit sectors.
Although the money will flow through the EU budget, it is likely to be spent early in the next budget period from 2021 to 2027. There are different options for dealing with the debt load created by the fund - it could be paid back over a long period, or continuously rolled over. The latter option is preferable given the likely high demand for these safe assets in financial markets.
As described by Merkel, the Franco-German proposal would mean that the debt servicing (the repayment of interest and principal) would be done through funds allocated to the EU through contributions from the member states, based on their share in the regular EU budget.
This would mean Italy would need to contribute around 15 per cent of these new liabilities. As a result, this technically increases the Italian state’s liabilities by around €75 billion, although accounting rules mean this will probably remain off the state’s balance sheet and thus not increase its headline debt to GDP ratio.
To be net beneficiaries, countries must receive more from the fund than their share of liabilities. Therefore, if the EU spends more than €75 billion of the recovery fund in Italy, the country will be coming out ahead and it would constitute a transfer from those less in need to those more in need.
Given the relative severity of the coronavirus-related disruption, this is likely to be the case. However, given that other large countries, most notably Spain, have also been hit hard, there will be a limit to the upside for Italy. All member states, not just eurozone countries, will need to receive some of this money, with the political bargaining meaning it likely can’t be too far off from their share of the liability.
Assuming that spending from the fund in Italy is just over 50 per cent more than its share of the liabilities, at €115 billion or 6 per cent of Italy’s 2019 GDP it would constitute an increase in spending in Italy of around 2-3 per cent of GDP for the next couple of years. Some of this spending could have happened without the fund. But this would have come with higher debt servicing costs and it is thus safe to call this plan a significant fiscal boost for Italy, and other fiscally weaker economies.
A fiscal boost should not be confused with a revolution. Some have referred to this as a 'Hamiltonian' moment for the eurozone, referring to the American treasury secretary who bartered the compromise that led to the US federal government assuming the debts incurred by the states during the war of independence.
However, the recovery fund would, for now, remain a one-off and European countries will remain liable for their current debt loads, and for the increase in their debt stocks that will result from the coronacrisis anyway. The European Commission forecasts that the Italian debt stock will increase from 135 per cent of GDP last year to 153 per cent at the end of next year.
The size of the fiscal stimulus provided by the fund means it is likely to boost the growth potential for the Italian economy, particularly if accompanied by other reforms, as the plan suggests it should. However, it would require an unrealistically large boost to significantly improve Italian debt dynamics, especially given the disruption from the coronavirus crisis is going to be felt for a long time anyway.
The Italian state will continue to have to aim for large primary surpluses to finance interest expenditures significantly higher than that of its eurozone peers. If you believed that the Italian situation was economically and politically unsustainable over the long term before the crisis, even a larger version of this fund should not change your mind.
The recovery fund could turn out to be a template for future crisis responses and thereby represent a move towards a proper Hamiltonian moment. But as the fund is an EU instrument, instead of a eurozone instrument, this is harder. Furthermore, the next crisis is unlikely to be as symmetrical as the current one, meaning it will be even more difficult to get those member states already opposed to this plan to agree to a repetition or an expansion into something more like a fiscal union.
This does not mean the recovery fund is a bad idea. On the contrary, it should be welcomed as part of the EU’s response to the COVID-19 crisis. Ensuring the southern economies can recover is also in the interest of the fiscally stronger EU member states, who rely on their neighbours to buy many of their exports.
Furthermore, it would be something of a bargain for them, as it should only cost them their share of the interest costs and some of the fund will be spent in their economies. If that is too much to ask in solidarity, the EU has much bigger problems.

But as the fund is an EU instrument, instead of a eurozone instrument, this is harder. Furthermore, the next crisis is unlikely to be as symmetrical as the current one, meaning it will be even more difficult to get those member states already opposed to this plan to agree to a repetition or an expansion into something more like a fiscal union.
This does not mean the recovery fund is a bad idea. On the contrary, it should be welcomed as part of the EU’s response to the COVID-19 crisis. Ensuring the southern economies can recover is also in the interest of the fiscally stronger EU member states, who rely on their neighbours to buy many of their exports.
Furthermore, it would be something of a bargain for them, as it should only cost them their share of the interest costs and some of the fund will be spent in their economies. If that is too much to ask in solidarity, the EU has much bigger problems.

Does Restricting Travel During a Pandemic Work?,UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/does-restricting-travel-during-pandemic-work,Expert Comment,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has consistently advised against restricting travel and trade during outbreaks. But most countries have still imposed restrictions to prevent the import of COVID-19. WHO needs to rethink its approach.
The great majority of countries have imposed partial or total travel bans on incoming non-residents since COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30.

On January 31, President Donald Trump announced a . By the end of March .
WHO’s guidance on travel and trade derives from the  (IHR), agreed by WHO member states in 2005. Their purpose is 'to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.’
There are three strands in WHO’s position. First, WHO is concerned that countries may be reluctant to notify it of an emerging infection (as the IHR obliges) if they believe it will result in economically damaging restrictions imposed by other countries (for instance, affecting trade or tourism). Second, travel bans cause problems for the supply of technical assistance and essential supplies to affected countries.
Third,  and that domestic measures to contain outbreaks (such as testing, isolating the sick, and contact tracing or social distancing) are far more important. However, it accepts that temporary restrictions may be justified at the beginning of an outbreak in order to buy time – ‘even if only a few days’ – for increasing preparedness. Such restrictions should be proportionate to the public health risk, short in duration and regularly reviewed.
Initial flight cancellations resulted directly from China’s lockdown in Wuhan on January 23 which closed the airport. In late January many governments advised their citizens against travel to China, which led many airlines to cancel all flights to China. In March, as it became clear that the epidemic was spreading very fast, particularly in Europe and the US, most countries introduced travel bans.
The evidence of past studies on influenza and a few other emerging diseases suggests travel bans have limited effect. A review of their impact in the 2009 H1N1 epidemic concluded that even very drastic restrictions taken early on might have , with limited impact on the ultimate size of the pandemic.
The impact was weakest where the virus had, like COVID-19, relatively high transmissibility. One early study on the spread of COVID-19 suggested that  to reduce transmission. However, the study notes the lockdown in Wuhan, by slowing the international spread from Wuhan directly and indirectly from elsewhere in China, temporarily reduced imported cases in other countries by 80 per cent up to mid-February.
The evidence from previous outbreaks largely supports the position taken by WHO – but it mainly relates to outbreaks of flu or other emerging diseases whose characteristics are significantly different from COVID-19. Moreover, the global impact of COVID-19 is of a different order of magnitude to any outbreaks since the Spanish flu in 1918. In particular, the disease has achieved a global spread far more rapidly than most governments seem to have anticipated.
By the time WHO announced a public health emergency and Trump announced his travel ban there were already recorded cases in 18 countries other than China, including in Europe and the US. In those circumstances, a ban on travel from just one country is unlikely to be effective.

By the time most other countries announced their travel bans in March, the epidemic had affected most of Europe and the US and been declared a pandemic by WHO. This is why so many countries introduced global bans on incoming non-residents while also advising their residents not to travel.
It seems most countries were closing the stable door after the horse had bolted. It is understandable that governments, frightened by the exponential growth of cases from early March in many countries, adopted a belt and braces approach including lockdowns and travel bans. However, the evidence that travel bans at that stage of the epidemic made a material difference to the developing pandemic is largely absent while also having the side effect of stranding numerous travellers abroad.
Where travel restrictions may have an effect is when the case level is very low at the beginning of an outbreak, or as case numbers decline to low levels as it is controlled. Then imported cases could be an important focus for outbreaks. Thus, while the threat from rising cases in Western countries grew, travel or quarantine restrictions were introduced in countries such as South Korea and China which had managed to restrict their outbreaks.

Coronavirus Crisis: Exploring the Human Impact on Nature,UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/coronavirus-crisis-exploring-human-impact-nature,Expert Comment,"Tim Benton and Richard Kock speak to Gitika Bhardwaj about how human activities are making outbreaks, like the coronavirus, more likely.


The fundamental job of pathogens throughout evolution has been to maximize their chances of infecting susceptible organisms. Pathogens can live in lots of different host organisms and so they are continually looking for an opportunity to jump from one species to another. Some pathogens are particularly good at this like the coronavirus.
Certain species of animals, like bats, appear to have immune systems that harbour a lot of organisms living inside of them naturally, but their immune systems can cope with it, and they become, kind of, reservoirs of diseases.  
These pathogens then seek the opportunity to jump to another species. But where are they going to find a new host? Well, from an environmental perspective, when humans change the environment, such as by changing the climate, we cause animals to move around the landscape, often migrating northwards towards the Northern Hemisphere, which drives different animals to come into contact with us.
Similarly, when we degrade habitats, animals are forced to squeeze together with other animals into smaller areas. If we then come into contact with these animals, then we risk the pathogens living inside of them, jumping across to us.
The same is true when humans migrate to urban centres which are reservoirs of diseases too. Rats are a prime example of an animal which hosts a lot of pathogens and are common to find in cities, and people, particularly low-wage people, often come into contact with them. 
So climate change, habitat change and our own societal changes are creating new ecologies which are leading us to mix with those new ecologies in new ways and giving the perfect opportunity for pathogens to make a leap across to us.
100 years ago, we didn’t have the tools to understand what viruses were so part of the apparent increasing emergence of these diseases is the fact that we’re better able to detect them. 
But the movement of a virus from an animal to a human is important. Pathogens jumping to another species is actually an extremely rare event.
HIV, for example, was a rare event in the 1950s that led to a disease that spread throughout the human population.
Measles, too, is a common disease among humans but was believed to have spilt over from cattle to humans in the 15th century.
But this is what evolution is all about. This, sort of, crisscrossing is happening all the time but the chance of you or I getting a zoonosis directly from an animal is actually extremely rare. In fact, the most likely zoonosis that humans might get would be from a domestic animal. Dogs, for example, can give us rabies and there are around 50,000 cases of rabies a year around the world.
We should remember that wildlife is not a threat to us. We are a threat to it, and to ourselves, because we create the conditions for spill-overs of diseases to happen. How do we do this? By invading their environment and, in that process, there is a risk that the pathogens that they carry see an opportunity to jump into us as a new host. So the only person at fault here is us.

 The coronavirus outbreak is another example of the fact that, increasingly, as we change our environment, we are creating the conditions for society to get hit by diseases: whether it’s the coronavirus or something like bluetongue, which is an animal disease impacting livestock, or Ug99 which is a disease impacting wheat.
But it’s not just about pandemics occurring but the subsequent impacts they can have on human health, for example, the impacts to our livestock systems and our crop systems and, therefore, food availability and the nutrition that underpins our ability to fight diseases like the coronavirus.
When you put all of these pieces together, we shouldn’t just be worried about pandemics occurring, but the increasing shocks to society that could happen in all sorts of ways as a result.
Yes human activities have led to a greater risk of pathogens transmitting from animals and humans, from deforestation, to agriculture, to mining. 
Population demography is also a problem. There are a lot more people now than there used to be and they increasingly migrate to urban centres where they live alongside a large population of domestic animals – in fact the biomass of domestic animals is about three times the biomass of humans – it’s massive. This is a huge problem because it creates a close connection between us.
Take a rat, a crow, a seagull or a fox. They basically feed off of human waste because we consume all of the natural resources. Bats fly and rats hide but they’re very good at surviving very close to human habitation. That’s why certain domestic species are a greater threat to us because they’re able to occupy the same space as we do and therefore spill-overs of pathogens from them to us are much more likely. 
MERS-CoV, which has been developing since 2012, came from a camel which is also a domesticated animal often found in farms in the Middle East. These farms become like pathogen factories where the virus can spill over to humans, and then human-to-human, until we get an outbreak which is what I suspect happened with COVID-19.
Similarly, if you look at the evidence for SARS, we had the civet cat and the raccoon dog which are both domesticated ex-wild animals used for the fur and meat trades in Asia.
So if you put the bats and the rats to one side, it’s also the animals that we’re exploiting directly that are the greatest threat to us but, ultimately, the threat is caused by us.

We can’t continue as we are because it’s taking us to a situation where we are undermining the ability of our species to survive.
The coronavirus crisis is interesting because it is a wake-up call for governments and it's generating much more hard-headed thinking about the challenges of the future. 
I’ve been working on these issues for decades now and I remember having conversations with the UK government in the past about the risk of environmental breakdown to our food system. The UK government’s response then was that the market will sort everything out but I think there is very different thinking now. I just hope that we make the changes needed fast enough.
One of the most interesting things that I experienced in my career was in 2015, when I was in Kazakhstan, which has a beautiful steppe habitat with very extreme weather. This is where historically the mammoths and the sabre tooth tigers come from and also a species called the saiga antelope. It’s a fast-reproducing antelope that still lives in Central Asia having survived the Pleistocene, unlike many species, although they’re now a critically endangered species.
We started seeing a phenomenon there – a disease wiping out the population – over an area the size of the UK. 230,000 animals died over a period of about three weeks. It was extraordinary. We found out there was a bacteria that is quite common around the world called Pasteurella multocida which was, for some reason, suddenly able to invade each individual saiga antelope across the landscape. But there had been no transmission of the bacteria meaning the bacteria must’ve been present in the animal beforehand.
We then found that a recent change in the weather had caused the bacteria to become activated inside of the animals. I’m not saying it was climate change but it’s amazing what happened with a change in the climate: a warm-blooded mammal was affected by a pathogen due to a change in the environmental conditions and had a 100 per cent mortality rate. Climate change, however, will bring these types of conditions about more often which could lead to a 100 per cent mortality of the human population. 
COVID-19 has a 1-2 per cent mortality rate which is extremely mild yet look what it does to our economy. We must wake up as humans and realize that there are existential threats out there, through our own fault, which could eliminate us as a species, and the sooner we wake up, the better.


 It’s interesting because, although we’ve got a blip in terms of a temporary reduction in CO2 emissions, it’s not a reduction in CO2 in the atmosphere. So, in one sense, that brings home that being Paris-compliant is a huge ask because if still, under all of the rigours of the lockdown we’re currently in, we’re still thereabouts for what we would have to do to be Paris-compliant, then that shows how far we’ve still got to go. 
But I think the more important question is whether the current crisis is changing people’s attitudes towards nature so that when they come out of lockdown the say: ‘Enough is enough.’ 
So, rather than the silver lining being that the environment is healing itself, the silver lining might be that people come out of lockdown and say: ‘We want to make sure that this sort of thing never happens again and that requires us to live in different ways as we move ahead.’
You know, I think we rather burden ourselves with this belief that we can’t change but we could reduce our meat consumption by 75 per cent next week. It’s going to have implications for the meat industry but, the fact is, it can all be done in about a week.
Similarly, if you reduce the livestock population by 75 per cent, think of the space you’d create. Massive areas of land will suddenly become available to nature. When it comes to biodiversity, we don’t have to do anything, nature will do it itself. 
To me, the solution is straightforward. If you restore the land, and the forests, and the oceans, then you’ll restore the natural processes but humans have to make that decision.

In the run-up to the emergence of the coronavirus, we had Extinction Rebellion, Greta Thunberg, the COP in Madrid and a whole host of things gearing up for 2020 to be a ‘super year’. 
There were a lot of things that were shifting public attitudes in the direction of wanting to embrace more sustainable living and now what we have is people starting to recognize that the coronavirus outbreak is not just a global health emergency but an environmental issue.
So I think there is a chance, after decades of being told as citizens that we can’t act on climate change because it’s too expensive, we will. If there are enough people coming out of lockdown saying, we want to make sure that our recovery is a green recovery, then we can do it, but it is a societal choice.
You know there are many societies and religious communities around the world who recognize the importance of nature but, unfortunately, in the speed of modern life, we’ve lost sight of it particularly in the West. However, people are beginning to recognize that climate change is not a good thing, biodiversity loss is not a good thing and are seeking ways to solve it. 
The problem is that we have many people who have no interest in wellbeing at all. Most people, who have decided for humans throughout history what the right pathway for development is, have not considered the value of each society and whether it does a good or bad thing for the planet.
They have instead given value to ways of life that are harmful to our wellbeing and, ultimately, to the environment. So I think we need to change our value systems and orient people away from the sort of pathway that we’ve chosen. 


For me it’s all of the above. It’s a simple question at one level because I’d like to see a better world but a fiendishly difficult question at another level because we don’t yet have a vision for what a green future should be like that everybody buys into.
But, certainly, there are things we can do. We have the ability to make sure that we have renewable energy at the root of our energy systems and we can move towards more sustainable transport and more sustainable diets.
In fact, food is an interesting example because if you think about the morbidities that have been associated with deaths resulting from COVID-19, after age and gender, obesity and the diseases associated with obesity, like diabetes, are high risk factors.
So if we are going to have more resilient health systems in the future then we have to have some movement towards preventative healthcare which means healthier diets.
If we’re eating healthier diets, that means growing different things and farming in different ways, which means a revolution in farming to make it more sustainable.
We would then have more biodiversity in the landscape because we wouldn’t be growing lots of the wrong food that makes us ill on large swathes of land. 
Sustainability is all about everyone living within the boundaries that the planet has set. It’s not about driving economic growth at the expense of everything else. It’s about using the economy to provide wellbeing to all. 
I think it would be great if wealthier countries after the crisis realize, actually, are slower economies all that bad? 
Some argue that people won’t have jobs in slower economies, but if we are fair in the way we distribute our resources, we’ll see significant benefits to our wellbeing.
I’m hoping that the experience of the coronavirus crisis will teach us all a lesson that, yes, this was uncomfortable but we can cope and that we as a society can get through these things if we make some changes.


Everything is linked together. Putting them under the One Health agenda, therefore, just makes a hell of a lot of sense to me. We have to start thinking about human and planetary health all within the same envelope.
 I’m a great believer in a multidisciplinary approach. One Health, to me, is about recognizing the need to look at human health from the perspective of creating a healthy environment.
But it’s important to point out that health isn’t just a job for doctors and vets. It’s society’s job. Politicians need to ask themselves: ‘Do we want a healthy society?’ If so, then they need to recognize there are certain limits to the way we exploit the planet. 
I’m afraid some international organizations are struggling to practise One Health at the moment too. They talk about One Health but they don’t sit down together to discuss solutions as they should. For example, with the current coronavirus crisis, if this had been a problem within the animal population then we would’ve stopped movement in January and there wouldn’t have been a coronavirus crisis. It’s a shame that there hasn’t been a cross-disciplinary approach to guide some of the public health strategies so far.
I have, however, been working with about 300 international experts on COVID-19 and what has been great is that we’ve got vets, modellers and scientists all talking to each other and that’s One Health. 

The huge roadblock to a global approach is that there isn’t one. We’re now in a place that is effectively unimaginable compared to, say, a decade ago.
If you look back to the turn of the century, there were people legitimately asking about whether we are living in a post-nation state world because, at the time, we felt like we were global citizens because of the liberal architecture of international co-operation.
But now, just a decade later, we’ve had undermining of the World Trade Organization and the World Health Organization, withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, international trade wars, all of which, a few years ago, would have been unthinkable. Everywhere – left, right and centre – we have moved away from international co-operation to international competition. 
So I think we’re going in the wrong direction if we are to meaningfully tackle the challenges ahead particularly the urgency of climate change and environmental issues in general.
But we have a window of opportunity over the next decade or so, but if that window of opportunity closes, then we’ve lost.  
You know, they always say, it takes a crisis to get a solution. Isn’t that terrible? But it does seem throughout human history that you need a crisis for things to get sorted because the shock of it gets people to say: ‘We have to change.’ So, yes, I think the COVID-19 pandemic gives us an opportunity to change. 
This talk about getting rid of the World Health Organization is a result of a type of politics that has been developing which is a reflection of the people who don’t want to see change. We vote for these strong leaders with popular support who look as if they’re going to solve everything. Let’s take responsibility ourselves to solve these problems but in a way where there are checks and balances.
I believe we’ll get back to an integrated politics where we can have people with a strong green agenda, a strong industry agenda and a strong health agenda working together but we need to get the balance right if we are to move forward. 
It is true that national and international institutions can become ankylosed and so I think we need to refresh our institutions, otherwise if we don’t, we will find that they no longer work, and in many of our democracies, that’s been the problem.

I’m less hopeful now than I was a year ago. I think there is potential for the current COVID-19 pandemic to create a sea change in public and political opinion as we go through the next year or so.
If you think about some of the flashpoints around the world, in the countries that are suffering the most, they’re either vulnerable countries or they’re countries where there’s nationalist, populist, inward-looking governments. But those that are feeling the pandemic the most could create, if those governments change, a huge change in the way we collectively work at an international level. 
However, I do think at the moment we’re not seeing enough of the scale of international cooperation that we’ve had in the past such as during the food price spike and the global financial crash between 2007-08.
My optimism therefore sits with those governments around the world who want to tackle these existential threats. We can’t wait for those countries who don’t want to work together to come around to our way of thinking. We have just got to find ways of making sure that there are coalitions that are willing to push ahead fast enough.
It’s not an entirely positive place to be, but I think, if we want it enough, we as citizens can let our feelings be known and hopefully that will create some degree of political momentum.
 I’m hopeful but those people who believe in the green agenda can’t do it alone. They’ve got to bring the rest of society along with them.
We can do this by developing understanding across society, by stopping the separation of responsibilities and realizing we’re all responsible and then, I believe, things will change – they’ve changed in the past and there’s no reason why they can’t change again in the future.  
We’ve got extinctions happening at an unprecedented rate, but if we can change now, within the next 50 years, nature will be back. 
I’m particularly optimistic that young people can force these changes and there are a few of us, at the end of our careers, who will join them too. 
",2020/5/22, Professor Tim Benton,Chatham House,,,Coronavirus Crisis: Exploring the Human Impact on Nature,"Tim Benton and Richard Kock speak to Gitika Bhardwaj about how human activities are making outbreaks, like the coronavirus, more likely.


The fundamental job of pathogens throughout evolution has been to maximize their chances of infecting susceptible organisms. Pathogens can live in lots of different host organisms and so they are continually looking for an opportunity to jump from one species to another. Some pathogens are particularly good at this like the coronavirus.
Certain species of animals, like bats, appear to have immune systems that harbour a lot of organisms living inside of them naturally, but their immune systems can cope with it, and they become, kind of, reservoirs of diseases.  
These pathogens then seek the opportunity to jump to another species. But where are they going to find a new host? Well, from an environmental perspective, when humans change the environment, such as by changing the climate, we cause animals to move around the landscape, often migrating northwards towards the Northern Hemisphere, which drives different animals to come into contact with us.
Similarly, when we degrade habitats, animals are forced to squeeze together with other animals into smaller areas. If we then come into contact with these animals, then we risk the pathogens living inside of them, jumping across to us.
The same is true when humans migrate to urban centres which are reservoirs of diseases too. Rats are a prime example of an animal which hosts a lot of pathogens and are common to find in cities, and people, particularly low-wage people, often come into contact with them. 
So climate change, habitat change and our own societal changes are creating new ecologies which are leading us to mix with those new ecologies in new ways and giving the perfect opportunity for pathogens to make a leap across to us.
100 years ago, we didn’t have the tools to understand what viruses were so part of the apparent increasing emergence of these diseases is the fact that we’re better able to detect them. 
But the movement of a virus from an animal to a human is important. Pathogens jumping to another species is actually an extremely rare event.
HIV, for example, was a rare event in the 1950s that led to a disease that spread throughout the human population.
Measles, too, is a common disease among humans but was believed to have spilt over from cattle to humans in the 15th century.
But this is what evolution is all about. This, sort of, crisscrossing is happening all the time but the chance of you or I getting a zoonosis directly from an animal is actually extremely rare. In fact, the most likely zoonosis that humans might get would be from a domestic animal. Dogs, for example, can give us rabies and there are around 50,000 cases of rabies a year around the world.
We should remember that wildlife is not a threat to us. We are a threat to it, and to ourselves, because we create the conditions for spill-overs of diseases to happen. How do we do this? By invading their environment and, in that process, there is a risk that the pathogens that they carry see an opportunity to jump into us as a new host. So the only person at fault here is us.

 The coronavirus outbreak is another example of the fact that, increasingly, as we change our environment, we are creating the conditions for society to get hit by diseases: whether it’s the coronavirus or something like bluetongue, which is an animal disease impacting livestock, or Ug99 which is a disease impacting wheat.
But it’s not just about pandemics occurring but the subsequent impacts they can have on human health, for example, the impacts to our livestock systems and our crop systems and, therefore, food availability and the nutrition that underpins our ability to fight diseases like the coronavirus.
When you put all of these pieces together, we shouldn’t just be worried about pandemics occurring, but the increasing shocks to society that could happen in all sorts of ways as a result.
Yes human activities have led to a greater risk of pathogens transmitting from animals and humans, from deforestation, to agriculture, to mining. 
Population demography is also a problem. There are a lot more people now than there used to be and they increasingly migrate to urban centres where they live alongside a large population of domestic animals – in fact the biomass of domestic animals is about three times the biomass of humans – it’s massive. This is a huge problem because it creates a close connection between us.
Take a rat, a crow, a seagull or a fox. They basically feed off of human waste because we consume all of the natural resources. Bats fly and rats hide but they’re very good at surviving very close to human habitation. That’s why certain domestic species are a greater threat to us because they’re able to occupy the same space as we do and therefore spill-overs of pathogens from them to us are much more likely. 
MERS-CoV, which has been developing since 2012, came from a camel which is also a domesticated animal often found in farms in the Middle East. These farms become like pathogen factories where the virus can spill over to humans, and then human-to-human, until we get an outbreak which is what I suspect happened with COVID-19.
Similarly, if you look at the evidence for SARS, we had the civet cat and the raccoon dog which are both domesticated ex-wild animals used for the fur and meat trades in Asia.
So if you put the bats and the rats to one side, it’s also the animals that we’re exploiting directly that are the greatest threat to us but, ultimately, the threat is caused by us.

We can’t continue as we are because it’s taking us to a situation where we are undermining the ability of our species to survive.
The coronavirus crisis is interesting because it is a wake-up call for governments and it's generating much more hard-headed thinking about the challenges of the future. 
I’ve been working on these issues for decades now and I remember having conversations with the UK government in the past about the risk of environmental breakdown to our food system. The UK government’s response then was that the market will sort everything out but I think there is very different thinking now. I just hope that we make the changes needed fast enough.
One of the most interesting things that I experienced in my career was in 2015, when I was in Kazakhstan, which has a beautiful steppe habitat with very extreme weather. This is where historically the mammoths and the sabre tooth tigers come from and also a species called the saiga antelope. It’s a fast-reproducing antelope that still lives in Central Asia having survived the Pleistocene, unlike many species, although they’re now a critically endangered species.
We started seeing a phenomenon there – a disease wiping out the population – over an area the size of the UK. 230,000 animals died over a period of about three weeks. It was extraordinary. We found out there was a bacteria that is quite common around the world called Pasteurella multocida which was, for some reason, suddenly able to invade each individual saiga antelope across the landscape. But there had been no transmission of the bacteria meaning the bacteria must’ve been present in the animal beforehand.
We then found that a recent change in the weather had caused the bacteria to become activated inside of the animals. I’m not saying it was climate change but it’s amazing what happened with a change in the climate: a warm-blooded mammal was affected by a pathogen due to a change in the environmental conditions and had a 100 per cent mortality rate. Climate change, however, will bring these types of conditions about more often which could lead to a 100 per cent mortality of the human population. 
COVID-19 has a 1-2 per cent mortality rate which is extremely mild yet look what it does to our economy. We must wake up as humans and realize that there are existential threats out there, through our own fault, which could eliminate us as a species, and the sooner we wake up, the better.


 It’s interesting because, although we’ve got a blip in terms of a temporary reduction in CO2 emissions, it’s not a reduction in CO2 in the atmosphere. So, in one sense, that brings home that being Paris-compliant is a huge ask because if still, under all of the rigours of the lockdown we’re currently in, we’re still thereabouts for what we would have to do to be Paris-compliant, then that shows how far we’ve still got to go. 
But I think the more important question is whether the current crisis is changing people’s attitudes towards nature so that when they come out of lockdown the say: ‘Enough is enough.’ 
So, rather than the silver lining being that the environment is healing itself, the silver lining might be that people come out of lockdown and say: ‘We want to make sure that this sort of thing never happens again and that requires us to live in different ways as we move ahead.’
You know, I think we rather burden ourselves with this belief that we can’t change but we could reduce our meat consumption by 75 per cent next week. It’s going to have implications for the meat industry but, the fact is, it can all be done in about a week.
Similarly, if you reduce the livestock population by 75 per cent, think of the space you’d create. Massive areas of land will suddenly become available to nature. When it comes to biodiversity, we don’t have to do anything, nature will do it itself. 
To me, the solution is straightforward. If you restore the land, and the forests, and the oceans, then you’ll restore the natural processes but humans have to make that decision.

In the run-up to the emergence of the coronavirus, we had Extinction Rebellion, Greta Thunberg, the COP in Madrid and a whole host of things gearing up for 2020 to be a ‘super year’. 
There were a lot of things that were shifting public attitudes in the direction of wanting to embrace more sustainable living and now what we have is people starting to recognize that the coronavirus outbreak is not just a global health emergency but an environmental issue.
So I think there is a chance, after decades of being told as citizens that we can’t act on climate change because it’s too expensive, we will. If there are enough people coming out of lockdown saying, we want to make sure that our recovery is a green recovery, then we can do it, but it is a societal choice.
You know there are many societies and religious communities around the world who recognize the importance of nature but, unfortunately, in the speed of modern life, we’ve lost sight of it particularly in the West. However, people are beginning to recognize that climate change is not a good thing, biodiversity loss is not a good thing and are seeking ways to solve it. 
The problem is that we have many people who have no interest in wellbeing at all. Most people, who have decided for humans throughout history what the right pathway for development is, have not considered the value of each society and whether it does a good or bad thing for the planet.
They have instead given value to ways of life that are harmful to our wellbeing and, ultimately, to the environment. So I think we need to change our value systems and orient people away from the sort of pathway that we’ve chosen. 


For me it’s all of the above. It’s a simple question at one level because I’d like to see a better world but a fiendishly difficult question at another level because we don’t yet have a vision for what a green future should be like that everybody buys into.
But, certainly, there are things we can do. We have the ability to make sure that we have renewable energy at the root of our energy systems and we can move towards more sustainable transport and more sustainable diets.
In fact, food is an interesting example because if you think about the morbidities that have been associated with deaths resulting from COVID-19, after age and gender, obesity and the diseases associated with obesity, like diabetes, are high risk factors.
So if we are going to have more resilient health systems in the future then we have to have some movement towards preventative healthcare which means healthier diets.
If we’re eating healthier diets, that means growing different things and farming in different ways, which means a revolution in farming to make it more sustainable.
We would then have more biodiversity in the landscape because we wouldn’t be growing lots of the wrong food that makes us ill on large swathes of land. 
Sustainability is all about everyone living within the boundaries that the planet has set. It’s not about driving economic growth at the expense of everything else. It’s about using the economy to provide wellbeing to all. 
I think it would be great if wealthier countries after the crisis realize, actually, are slower economies all that bad? 
Some argue that people won’t have jobs in slower economies, but if we are fair in the way we distribute our resources, we’ll see significant benefits to our wellbeing.
I’m hoping that the experience of the coronavirus crisis will teach us all a lesson that, yes, this was uncomfortable but we can cope and that we as a society can get through these things if we make some changes.


Everything is linked together. Putting them under the One Health agenda, therefore, just makes a hell of a lot of sense to me. We have to start thinking about human and planetary health all within the same envelope.
 I’m a great believer in a multidisciplinary approach. One Health, to me, is about recognizing the need to look at human health from the perspective of creating a healthy environment.
But it’s important to point out that health isn’t just a job for doctors and vets. It’s society’s job. Politicians need to ask themselves: ‘Do we want a healthy society?’ If so, then they need to recognize there are certain limits to the way we exploit the planet. 
I’m afraid some international organizations are struggling to practise One Health at the moment too. They talk about One Health but they don’t sit down together to discuss solutions as they should. For example, with the current coronavirus crisis, if this had been a problem within the animal population then we would’ve stopped movement in January and there wouldn’t have been a coronavirus crisis. It’s a shame that there hasn’t been a cross-disciplinary approach to guide some of the public health strategies so far.
I have, however, been working with about 300 international experts on COVID-19 and what has been great is that we’ve got vets, modellers and scientists all talking to each other and that’s One Health. 

The huge roadblock to a global approach is that there isn’t one. We’re now in a place that is effectively unimaginable compared to, say, a decade ago.
If you look back to the turn of the century, there were people legitimately asking about whether we are living in a post-nation state world because, at the time, we felt like we were global citizens because of the liberal architecture of international co-operation.
But now, just a decade later, we’ve had undermining of the World Trade Organization and the World Health Organization, withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, international trade wars, all of which, a few years ago, would have been unthinkable. Everywhere – left, right and centre – we have moved away from international co-operation to international competition. 
So I think we’re going in the wrong direction if we are to meaningfully tackle the challenges ahead particularly the urgency of climate change and environmental issues in general.
But we have a window of opportunity over the next decade or so, but if that window of opportunity closes, then we’ve lost.  
You know, they always say, it takes a crisis to get a solution. Isn’t that terrible? But it does seem throughout human history that you need a crisis for things to get sorted because the shock of it gets people to say: ‘We have to change.’ So, yes, I think the COVID-19 pandemic gives us an opportunity to change. 
This talk about getting rid of the World Health Organization is a result of a type of politics that has been developing which is a reflection of the people who don’t want to see change. We vote for these strong leaders with popular support who look as if they’re going to solve everything. Let’s take responsibility ourselves to solve these problems but in a way where there are checks and balances.
I believe we’ll get back to an integrated politics where we can have people with a strong green agenda, a strong industry agenda and a strong health agenda working together but we need to get the balance right if we are to move forward. 
It is true that national and international institutions can become ankylosed and so I think we need to refresh our institutions, otherwise if we don’t, we will find that they no longer work, and in many of our democracies, that’s been the problem.

COVID-19: How to Finance the Debt?,UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/covid-19-how-finance-debt,Expert Comment,"Issuing more index-linked debt can be an important solution to help countries finance the unprecedented costs of the coronavirus crisis.
Many countries are beginning to ease the lockdowns and re-open their economies. But, even if this process succeeds globally, most countries are facing a sharp increase in their current fiscal deficits and public debt. The IMF estimates advanced country fiscal deficits will average 11% of GDP in 2020, while debt to GDP ratios will rise from an average of 105% in 2019 to 122% in 2020.
In the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, many governments focused on what maximum debt to GDP ratio would be ‘safe’ to protect them from loss of confidence in financial markets – although different considerations applied in the US as the dollar is the global reserve currency.
This time there is more focus on the cost of debt as, with extremely low long-term interest rates, a debt to GDP ratio well above 100% could still be consistent with a manageable burden on the taxpayer and stability in financial markets. But now it is becoming clearer that high levels of debt are likely to be sustained for a long period, governments should also review the form of their debt issuance and consider stepping up their issuance of index-linked debt.
Index-linked debt as a solution provides protection against inflation risk to both investors and the issuer. The principal invested and the interest payments received over the life of a bond are indexed to the consumer price level, so the real rate of return is fixed at the time of issue.
And a wide range of advanced countries already issue index-linked debt, including all members of the G7. In fact, the UK is one of the most prolific issuers with more than 20% of its total debt issuance in index-linked form.
Government debt managers are typically cautious about making radical shifts in issuance strategy so as to avoid disrupting markets. But despite that, there are several reasons why they should now consider a substantial increase in the proportion of long-term index-linked debt they issue.
First, given the real interest rate on index-linked debt is extremely low and sometimes even negative - currently -0.5% on ten-year US Treasury debt - the real burden on the government of this form of debt is guaranteed to remain low, and may even fall over its lifetime. The same cannot be said of nominal local currency debt or foreign currency debt, even when the nominal interest rate is extremely low.
Second, issuing index-linked debt hedges the government against the high degree of uncertainty over the future course of inflation. One current view is that sustained high unemployment and depressed demand could lead to a period of falling prices. But another is that the combination of supply constraints - due to the continuing effects of the pandemic on supply chains and the vast injection of liquidity by central banks through QE - will lead to a high level of inflation. However, if a government issues index-linked debt, its real cost will be the same regardless of what happens to inflation.
Third, issuing large amounts of index-linked debt could help reinforce the message that governments and central banks intend to grow their way out of high debt levels over the long-term, rather than resorting to an inequitable and distortionary inflation shock to devalue nominal government debt.
This potentially gives central banks and governments more credibility with financial markets, which in turn gives them more scope to deploy short-term measures such as QE and direct lending to governments without triggering a negative market response.
Such credibility also helps ensure that long-term rates on both public and private nominal debt remain low and stable. And it would underpin a widening in the short-term inflation target bands maintained by many central banks. This may add useful flexibility in making short-term monetary decisions.
This signalling effect might also make index-linked debt appropriate to finance the 500bn euro fund proposed by Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, reinforcing the message that the new vehicle - and the shift in the EU’s role it represents - is designed to be fully consistent with the ECB’s low inflation mandate.
Finally, increasing index-linked debt issuance now would be of benefit to pension funds, which need to lock in the eventual payments to those nearing pension age, and also low-income investors who cannot take the risk of investing in equities.
Low income investors would otherwise be forced to save through near-zero nominal interest rate accounts which risk delivering substantial negative real returns. There is actually a strong case for governments to offer positive real return index-linked savings accounts targeted on this group, even if it means effectively giving a subsidy relative to the cost of wholesale debt issuance.
There are currently two possible concerns with stepping up reliance on index-linked debt. First, the short-term problems that lockdown restrictions on consumer activity have created for measuring inflation. And the possibility that a sharp increase in index-linked issuance could outpace structural demand and lead to a rise in real yields which does not reflect the underlying economic fundamentals.
However, the lagged indexing process on index-linked debt typically gives time for any difficulties in inflation measurement to be sorted out, while debt managers will be able to monitor the impact of stepped up index-linked issuance on real yields and modify the strategy if needed.
Overall, index-linked debt offers a win-win solution for both governments and investors at a time of peak uncertainty about the future course of inflation. And it is an effective way for authorities to signal to both investors and the general public that - while they need to deploy monetary policy in an innovative and flexible way in the short-term - they do not intend to use inflation to default partially on the vast amounts of new debt they have to issue.
In short, those countries which have already been nurturing this instrument over several decades should take advantage of it.

"Together, African Countries Have Enough to Fight COVID-19",UK,https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/together-african-countries-have-enough-fight-covid-19,Expert Comment,"Africa can mount a stronger COVID-19 response strategy by using regional trade blocs to coordinate, consolidate, and connect resources across the continent.
Two opposing narratives have emerged about COVID-19 and Africa. The first is that cases are doubling, infections are increasing, and an uncontrollable swell of COVID-19 cases and deaths will soon overtake healthcare systems across the continent.
The other says that the epidemic in Africa may actually be subdued and that the continent has likely avoided catastrophe due to early action to prevent imported cases, as well as a young population.
A new modelling study from the WHO Africa Regional Office predicts the truth is likely somewhere in the middle. This new study estimates 47 African countries will not have as many severe cases or deaths as the rest of the world, but these countries should still  within this first year.
While this study may give some hope; across Africa fragile health systems exist in a milieu of other health, environmental and economic challenges. Therefore, this scenario is still concerning for individual countries that have, in general, overstretched healthcare systems during non-epidemic times.
 
The African Union’s Centre for Disease Control (ACDC), realized early on that African countries must act collectively. Since late January, they have responded with high-level coordination of resources, specialist training, and region-specific guidance for governments. While ACDC has , bigger tasks lie ahead to care for cases with acute respiratory infections across the AU’s 55 distinct member countries.
Furthermore, on a continent where it is estimated , restrictive public health response measures such as extended lockdowns could result in enormous damage to livelihoods in many countries, with wider health implications than COVID-19. Estimates of the  by the end of 2020, an outcome that could take 25 years to reverse.
The African Union has an opportunity to integrate its economic pillars into the Africa-wide response strategy by using Regional Economic Communities (RECs), the sub-regional blocs of African countries that have existed for decades. The most established RECs include the Arab Magreb Union (UMA), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Eastern African Community (EAC), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS).
While varying in performance, productivity, and cross-sectoral involvement, these RECs hold the common goal of harmonizing development and integrating the economic pursuits of their member nations. These existing relationships, shared social and cultural characteristics and tied economic and trade interests can be a strong foundation for a larger and better-resourced African COVID-19 response.
During this pandemic, surveillance at border crossings and monitoring migration patterns can help prevent or track and trace the spread of infections. RECs could play a part in coordinating the monitoring of border crossing activity, especially to align non-pharmaceutical interventions such as curfews, lockdowns, and rules on social gatherings. This is important since borders in Africa are often porous with ethnic groups regularly travelling between countries so social distancing measures may need to be tailored in these areas.
Initial attempts by the EAC to coordinate action by member states have not been successful and there are continued fears that certain groups, , are spreading the virus. However, working closely with public health institutions, RECs such as the EAC could help develop practical policies that accurately reflect the realities of land crossings and seaports and formalize their monitoring and reporting of border activities.
RECs are also well-placed to facilitate the consolidation of resources between and within sub-regions. The needs and strengths across these regions are different yet complementary – there is a need for a central body to understand this and coordinate matching needs with available resources across regions and countries.

",2020/5/28,Dr Ngozi Erondu,Chatham House,,,"Together, African Countries Have Enough to Fight COVID-19","Africa can mount a stronger COVID-19 response strategy by using regional trade blocs to coordinate, consolidate, and connect resources across the continent.
Two opposing narratives have emerged about COVID-19 and Africa. The first is that cases are doubling, infections are increasing, and an uncontrollable swell of COVID-19 cases and deaths will soon overtake healthcare systems across the continent.
The other says that the epidemic in Africa may actually be subdued and that the continent has likely avoided catastrophe due to early action to prevent imported cases, as well as a young population.
A new modelling study from the WHO Africa Regional Office predicts the truth is likely somewhere in the middle. This new study estimates 47 African countries will not have as many severe cases or deaths as the rest of the world, but these countries should still  within this first year.
While this study may give some hope; across Africa fragile health systems exist in a milieu of other health, environmental and economic challenges. Therefore, this scenario is still concerning for individual countries that have, in general, overstretched healthcare systems during non-epidemic times.
 
The African Union’s Centre for Disease Control (ACDC), realized early on that African countries must act collectively. Since late January, they have responded with high-level coordination of resources, specialist training, and region-specific guidance for governments. While ACDC has , bigger tasks lie ahead to care for cases with acute respiratory infections across the AU’s 55 distinct member countries.
Furthermore, on a continent where it is estimated , restrictive public health response measures such as extended lockdowns could result in enormous damage to livelihoods in many countries, with wider health implications than COVID-19. Estimates of the  by the end of 2020, an outcome that could take 25 years to reverse.
The African Union has an opportunity to integrate its economic pillars into the Africa-wide response strategy by using Regional Economic Communities (RECs), the sub-regional blocs of African countries that have existed for decades. The most established RECs include the Arab Magreb Union (UMA), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Eastern African Community (EAC), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS).
While varying in performance, productivity, and cross-sectoral involvement, these RECs hold the common goal of harmonizing development and integrating the economic pursuits of their member nations. These existing relationships, shared social and cultural characteristics and tied economic and trade interests can be a strong foundation for a larger and better-resourced African COVID-19 response.
During this pandemic, surveillance at border crossings and monitoring migration patterns can help prevent or track and trace the spread of infections. RECs could play a part in coordinating the monitoring of border crossing activity, especially to align non-pharmaceutical interventions such as curfews, lockdowns, and rules on social gatherings. This is important since borders in Africa are often porous with ethnic groups regularly travelling between countries so social distancing measures may need to be tailored in these areas.
